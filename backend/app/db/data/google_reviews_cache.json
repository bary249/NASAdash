I tried to give them some grace and the benefit of the doubt but it had been over two months since I was owed my deposit and I have yet to receive it. I have been either given the run around and told I would get a call back (which I didn\u2019t) or I\u2019m asked to email them and they never respond back. I have evidence of the emails where they didn\u2019t respond and call recordings with contradictions Aboit when they sent out the check. I will update this thread when I finally get a response and my refund. Used to be a great place to live, completely different experience. Also, they said I owed them money until I showed them that I paid my rent. I\u2019m sure if I took this long to pay them, it wouldn\u2019t be acceptable.

Staff are rude to tenants and email language to tenants is passive aggressive for things outside of their control. An example recently was from a notice of external facing doors of the property and a message was sent out saying tenants would be liable if found to leave the doors open.  The catch though - the doors are broken. Some don't even have a Spring Hinge/Self Closing Gate Hinge. They also don't work with the key fobs. Highly recommend any tenant to look elsewhere.",

The apartment is centered with lots of shopping and eats nearby so there was nothing short of boredom.

I had a faulty kitchen sink faucet once and the next day, maintenance replaced the entire faucet with a brand new one.

          "text": "I've been living at Parkside at Round Rock for about a year now and I can\u2019t recommend it enough! The customer service here is truly outstanding. From the moment I moved in, the leasing agent, assistant manager, and property manager have gone above and beyond to make sure all my needs are met. They\u2019re incredibly attentive, always ready to help with a smile, which really makes a difference in the overall experience of living here.\n\nThe apartments themselves are spacious and well-designed, offering fantastic value for the price. I love how much room I have to spread out, and the layouts are perfect for both relaxation and entertaining.\n\nOne of my favorite features is the dog park! It\u2019s a wonderful space where my pups can play and socialize with other dogs. Plus, the dog wash stations are a lifesaver\u2014no more messy baths at home after a fun day at the park!\n\nThe fitness center is another highlight, equipped with high-quality machines and plenty of space to work out. It\u2019s always clean and well-maintained, making it easy to stick to my fitness goals.\n\nThe location is also ideal. It\u2019s conveniently situated near shops, restaurants, and parks, making it easy to get out and enjoy everything the area has to offer.\n\nOverall, I love living here at Parkside! It feels like a community, and I\u2019m grateful for the friendly staff and great amenities. If you\u2019re considering a new place to live, definitely check this place out!",

I hope this review has helped keep the potential residents informed on what this apartment does to people during a pandemic.\nEdit: In reply to managements comment. We used to live at a sister property to this complex. We transfered our lease to Parkside for the job opportunities. We were led to believe that we would be having the exact same lease since both properties were owned by the same person and managed by Lincoln. We new that the lease breaking for the other property would be one months rent and a 30 day notice. We were under the impression that they had given us the exact same rules and lease transfer points. We both know we should have read more into the small print and finer points. But, we were too trusting of the company. Even now, there is still miscommunication between the team and leaders. We were told we could leave our keys and they would still allow us to pay the 60 day notice for each month's rent. Then we receive an email stating that if we left them our keys they want the extra $3000 immediately. We aren't asking for our money back. But, we want to keep others from making the same mistake we did and being screwed out of a lot of money during these times.\n\nYou should avoid Parkside at all costs. They take advantage of the pandemic and people losing jobs. My husband and I moved to Parkside for work. But, due to Covid, we are now having to relocate to Ohio. Parkside has demanded more then $7000 from us. Due to circumstances, our jobs are not able to help relocate. We owe more then $7000 after they have taken our deposits.  We are not the only ones, we have neighbors getting ready to take out loans so that they can provide for their family so that they can relocate for work. We tried talking to them to let them know we needed to relocate for jobs. They would not work with us. We asked if we could transfer our lease and were refused. Because of the Pandemic, they have revoked the ability to transfer to sister properties. This place is taking advantage of those being affected by Covid. This is such a bad company and apartment. We asked if we could set up a payment plan, and Ty in Leasing said he would ask corporate and ghosted us. I cannot voice how horrible this complex is. If you move here. Make sure to check every hidden fee as well as do not be in a situation of having to relocate due to jobs, family, and Covid. Also, we were the first ones living in the apartment.  And you can see how cheaply it is put together. We have had pants torn as well as cuts to ourselves and our dogs due to exposed painted over nails. Our cabinets lost their handles, and the drywall looks as if it is falling off the walls.",

As previous tenants stated, the property management changed a few times while living there & after move out it took 9 MONTHS to receive not even half of our security deposit. We left the unit spotless, professionally cleaned. They charge luxury prices but not a luxury experience!! Pitiful. They made it so difficult to get in contact with those in charge of returning deposits. I would call, email, left voicemails to property and the management company with no solution or help for 9months!!!! Ridiculous!! Also beware of the Ant problem it\u2019s true- 2 of our bedrooms and living room became infested with ants! It was terrible. Dog poop everywhere when walking around the property as well. If you have kids beware of the speeding in/near parking garage. They never ever had security gates put up either during that time which lead to theft of our property in Jan 2023. Hopefully some changes have been made- Beware!",

This bike room was first advertised to me as a complex amenity while taking a tour of the place. WHAT A JOKE. I never understood why there was a key card entry for the gym but not the bike room\u2026? There was even a security camera in the entree way of the building the bike room is in\u2014and still nothing was done by management to review footage and help me solve the theft. I had to file a police report and tried asking management to send me video footage from the security camera but I, along with the officer on my case, got nothing but RADIO SILENCE from the complex. They then lied to me about returning the officer\u2019s call. Management failed me in so many ways during my stay that the only thing I can do to feel better is to warn others. Don\u2019t live here! Don't fall for B.S. amenities they sell you. Your money is best spent somewhere else.",

Red ants in between the walls during the summer coming out the outlets. They charge $25 for useless fetch delivery services.

Anyone can drive in and through the complex, despite them advertising as a private parking lot.  This has been the case since Avenue 5 has purchased the property back in June 2021.  They have not been able to get trash cleanup under control.  They have not fixed issues with the mail room and now they keep YOUR packages in their office.  This makes it super inconvenient to get your mail.  The dog park is sad and often taken over by the same groups of people with hostile dogs that force you to leave.  The parking garage is a danger because this property has no speed bumps or mirrors or signage.  People speed all the time through here.  You cannot smoke inside the property yet there are no smoking designated areas outside.  There has been zero improvements made and in fact, many amenities are now worthless or not working here.  Yet they have the nerve to raise rent on everyone?  Do yourself a huge favor and ignore or move out of this complex.",

Lincoln, Assurance, then Greystar. When I moved in, the carpets were installed incorrectly leaving hills (which they are charging me for). There were always issues with the trash valet. And now that I moved out, they are charging me for damages that I did not make. They are also trying to charge me for things that don\u2019t appear damaged (the toilet photo). They even tried charging me for damage to my outside wall which people hit with furniture while moving in/out. I attached images of the items I tried to dispute with Sherron Joseph at Greystar but she would ignore my emails. Now they sent me to debt collections while still not responding to my questions. Shameful.\n\nUpdate: I paid the remaining note from when I was sent to collections. They were non negotiable and would not respond to my emails prior to the deadline. I decided to pay because I am just a person and they are a huge corp that would drown me in legal bills when they sue me.

The staff before and the staff currently 2022 have always been super friendly, caring and want the very best for the residents. There is no perfect property but coming from many other apt communities with a lot more issues I am glad to call Parkside home.\n\nStaff works very hard to keep up with everything and you are centrally located to any and everything you could want. Shopping, restaurants, gyms, movie theater, grocery stores and right off IH 35 or quick shot over to Toll 130. Really it is all within walking distance if you choose.  Two big dog parks for your fur kiddos and a super nice dog washing station.\n\nThe property is well thought out and the amenities are awesome. You won't need a gym membership or find a nicer pool area to enjoy right out side your front door. The apartments are spacious and offer many floor plans for your liking. Give it a TRY and you will find you are happy to call Parkside home as well.",

Our apartment also towed my car without warning and did not let me know leading me to panicking at 7:00 in the morning with no way to get to college and calling the police to try and figure out hat happened to my car. Furthermore parking that used to be free now cost money if you want to park by the doors. I recently was contacted by management after posting this review to a company survey and they ensured me they would look into it and get back to me the next day about making it up to me.

About eight months after Avenue 5 took over, it was not the smoothest transition, and unfortunately, they let the community go down. It is not what it once was but have they ever done anything that directly affected my living? The answer is no things they could work on would be making sure staff can answer questions and are available to answer the phone. This was very frustrating. Also, the turnover was horrible maintenance seems like they could use a little better guidance as work orders were being closed out but not done. Also, instead of nitpicking about yards and what people put on them, how about fixing the more prominent issues the complex has had since Avenue 5 took over? Would I recommend living here? I would, but you will need a lot of patience and need to ignore the problems that this company still hasn't figured out yet. I would give this a solid 3/5, and that's just me being lucky enough never to have problems with my specific unit hope they get it together apartment still has a lot of potentials.",

When logging into my leasing portal it clearly stated that my vehicle was there and was a vehicle for my unit. They said that it was not under my vip parking and they don\u2019t release the keys unless there is a vehicle signed up under that softwar. However, my keys were given to me without verification on that so this all fall backs on their lack of communication. Also, back track two months when I got the keys my unit was FILTHY with stains all over the fridge, dog hair in the unit, unmapped floors that after stepping on the floor with white socks turned my socks BLACK! I asked them to send someone to clean it the following day before I moved my furniture in when the furniture company got there on their time being paid from my own wallet the unit was not cleaned and was still in the same disgusting condition it was given to me in. As a new resident I am extremely disappointed in the customer service aspect of how things have been handled since the jump. Not to mention, they have an officer on the property who feels the need to harass residents like he\u2019s apart of the office staff and as a woman living in her unit alone that is quite intimidating and does not make me feel comfortable here at all. He asked me my unit number on multiple occasions which does not make me feel at home one bit. This has been a whole situation. Working two jobs and being in Nursing school I barely have free time to myself and to be late to class because my vehicle was towed without actually being contacted to see if there was some type of mistake or what is super disappointing.

There are neighbors who are chronic complainers about the smallest of things no matter what time of the day or night or week or weekend it may be and nothing is done about someone who is basically an apartment bully. With that said, the management team I have no fault with however, I do have very large issues with the fact that I can hear everything because the walls are so thin. The price is not worth it if I have to hear my neighbor's  loo flush and the conversations. Good place to live but I wouldn't recommend it either.",

          "text": "Update: 4/2023\nWhere to begin....this place is a mess, from the management/staff to the billing. We just moved out and were charged $10 (for a trashbag and other fraudulent fees - and they took our deposit (that they said they did not receive)). There was absolutely nothing in the apartment so, why did you charge for a trashbag? In our previous apartment unit, they charged $300 plus for a nail in the wall and carpet cleaning - cleaning they would normally do for each unit anyway - and for carpet that did NOT contain not one blemish or stain. This place is just a money pit. They CHARGE and CHARGE...but, take a look at the hallways, how they (do not) upkeep the buildings, the crime (yes - I will say it again) that occurs on the grounds. They claim this review is fraudulent but, if you live/lived there, you know what I mean...they sit in the office, look at their computers, and rack up the payments! They could care less about residents or the issues within the community - which is evident by their (lack of) action, over-billing, and deaf ears.\n\nOlder Review:\nIt appears Parkside has been removing some of their reviews.\nSo, I will add another one. Yesterday there were at least 15 Round Rock police officers in the complex, including SWAT - in a standoff for at least 4 hours. This is not acceptable. The management (2nd set since January of this year) need to be more mindful and selective of who they allow to move in...They are so focused on having 100% occupancy that they are not paying attention to red flags. The place is a hot mess.\n\nLooks good on the outside. On the inside the place is falling apart, literally.\n\nManagement is invisible within the community. On-site security is a joke. Some of the cameras on the property do not work. Our neighbor found this out the hard way when someone backed into her car. You get a different answer each time you enter the office - it depends on who to speak with. The staff follow-up is horrible. Trash piled up so high in the garages, it is ridiculous and the smell is horrible. The hallways contain blood, dog poop, dog hair, and other unmentionables. Maintenance shows up unannounced (even when no issue is reported).",

And my view is literally a chef's kiss. Great value for the price and super fab facilities all while being a stone's throw from beautiful east & downtown (if you're into that sorta thing). very clean when I moved in and already feels like home. Alexandria also goes out of her way to make folks feel included with various community activities etc.! a true shining star. Also S/O to the maintenance and pest control guys, they're 1-800-on-the-ball.\n\nMy only qualm would be that the towing company (that probably has an agreement w/ the building but idk) circle's the visitor lot each evening like blood-thirsty shahhks at feedin' time. It's extremely easy, (albeit slightly inconvenient) to register a guest's plate, make/model etc. on the app every time they visit- but also easy to forget and if you do- you're chum in the water my friend.\n\nI understand the towing company needs to get their bag, and this isn't the building per se, but  when I moved in my leg was broken so my sisters would come by a lot to help me out and I ran out of parking permits which sucked. Aside from that ONE inconvenient aspect, terrific experience.",

During my first few weeks here, I also noticed that even residents who live here seemed hesitant when walking me through the community. I tried to stay optimistic, but things have continued to go wrong.\n\nThey have repeatedly messed up my rent, and I\u2019ve had to go into the office multiple times to get it corrected. The hot water regularly goes out. Trash valet does not run nearly as smoothly as advertised. There are homeless individuals living in the dumpster area, and until very recently, there was no nighttime security at all. To be clear, they just hired nighttime security a couple of days ago, after months of ongoing issues reported by residents.\n\nThere are no security cameras in the hallways or parking lots because management claims it would be an \u201cinfringement of privacy,\u201d even though residents have repeatedly asked for basic safety measures. Packages go missing almost daily, despite management insisting their mail delivery system is \u201cfoolproof.\u201d It isn\u2019t. Someone\u2019s car was stolen (not towed\u2014stolen) from inside the gated parking lot.\n\nThe parking areas are constantly littered with residents\u2019 dog poop. I personally had a package stolen from the mailroom, and management admitted they have video footage of a homeless man entering and stealing packages. On top of that, my rental vehicle was towed even though I had a valid visitor permit.\n\nI\u2019ve lived here for less than two months and have experienced an unbelievable number of issues. There is an entire resident group chat that is nothing but daily complaints about how poorly this place is managed. I truly tried to stay positive and go with the flow, but I\u2019m exhausted by the constant problems and the lack of meaningful action from management.\n\nI do not recommend moving here.",

Huge island in the kitchen with white counter tops.\nVery new, paint is not chipped or gross.\nThe tubs are pretty big and wide.\nWalls in the units are pretty thick.\nThe pool/pool area is usually kept very clean\nThe building is About 10 minutes from the airport but you barley hear planes!\nThere\u2019s a community pool/billiards table.\nThere\u2019s a little market in the mail room full of snacks you can buy.\nThey\u2019ll do monthly community events like yoga or brunch!\n\nCONS:\nlots of security concern. Lots of package theft- even with their fetch service. Fetch has not the best hours too which aren\u2019t helpful if you work long days. Be prepared to buy a ring camera.\nShower water is finicky. Lots of water issues. Don\u2019t recommend if you love hot showers. This is my biggest issue\nWalking/parking near the dog park always smells like piss or poop :( people don\u2019t always use baggies to pick up the poop\nThe balconies that face the pool get COVERED in dust and dirt. It\u2019s hard to have furniture and plants.\nThey did a resident of the month event thing\u2026 and had an AI resident to win the prize \u2026\nThe hallways on the various floors are not cleaned often unless you ask them to clean it\n\nA lot of the reviews seem to be from people who only toured and haven\u2019t moved in so that made me wary\n\nFYI:\nBe very careful with guest parking because they always have tow trucks taking cars.\n\nApartment was not cleaned upon move in - BUT management did make it up to us with a credit towards our rent.\n\nIgnore reviews about grey star since kairoi is the new management.\n\nWith the X free weeks of move in deal, if you choose to Prorate rent it needs to be done manually with a money order. Can\u2019t be done through the app. Not awful just inconvenient.",

          "text": "This is the worst apartment I\u2019ve lived in for the price that they charge. Take recent reviews with a grain of salt because they capture the opinions of new residents rather than long term ones such as myself. On the surface it seems like a decent apartment. They have a nice business center, lobby, pool area, and rooftop. But I would say the praise ends there. Allen is the typically the one that responds to us the most so I will give them credit for that employee in specific.\n\nThere are systemic issues that only temporarily get fixed. Sometimes, the parking lot exit gates do not automatically open. The dog park is pathetic - it\u2019s small and has turf, which traps every type of smell from pet bathroom breaks. The residents as a whole don\u2019t care to pick up after their dogs. Consistent water pressure issues pop up every few months. Same with the elevator, which they don\u2019t care to fix permanently. Even when the elevator does work, there\u2019s always some sort of mess on the floor (the cleaning crew barely cleans it as is). The AC system gets overburdened and our electricity costs get driven up because it takes 2 hours to cool a small 1 bedroom. The printer periodically does not work. The staff does not care to upkeep the coffee machine. We went through a property management change where we switched from the horrendous Greystar to Kairoi. I will give the leasing office some credit for being a bit more responsive, however I don\u2019t think I should praise on-site staff for doing the bare minimum. They gave minimal notice when it came to the parking registration rules which is not legally complaint (I pointed it out and they did not respond) Given how they handle issues, I really don\u2019t think they care about improving the resident experience.

The lack of urgency from the maintenance team and the repeated breaking of the same things that have supposedly been fixed Is off the charts. For example, within the last three months, they have come to fix my microwave seven times. I understand that stuff happens although at some point, people are not doing their job. The leasing office Manager, Valerie is super dismissive of any issues and does the bare minimum to try and help out. The rest of the staff is really cool, although Valerie doesn\u2019t seem to value the tenant\u2019s time, money, or maintenance issues.

Again, having rented in Austin from greystar and maa for 7+ years I have never received a single lease violation, though after 4 months here have received 3.\n\nThe units themselves are fine aside from a major apartment wide mold issue l, but it\u2019s management that makes living in this community a complete nightmare. Management will find a reason to fine you at least once monthly. They overcharged me $70 for utilities and after months of back and forth where the leasing office assured me they would refund the mistake, the manager admitted he had no intention of doing this. There is a major issue with humidity in building one, leading many of the residents to find mold covering their clothes and shoes. I\u2019ve put in several work orders about abnormally high humidity levels (residents have reported upwards of 70% humidity recorded in unit) with no change. My walls and cabinets are often covered in condensation, and any paper goods in my unit are immediately damaged. If you\u2019re looking to get fined $50 for forgetting to bring your broom in after sweeping the patio of your apartment while the elevators, doors, and gates are constantly broken and the pool is constantly closed ( Don\u2019t forget about that mold issue) this is the place for you. If you like getting towed and receiving attitude from the leasing staff who will NOT refund you, or if you like it when your friends get towed (properly registered residents and visitors are often towed) or having your car stolen\u2026 this is a great place. I have never in my 7 years of renting dealt with such constant aggression and intense scrutiny from management and am excited to not renew my lease at this apartment.",

Nice pool with gas grills. One of the better onsite gyms I\u2019ve seen. Nice shared work space, lobby area and rooftop clubhouse but I don\u2019t really use those much. The ONE amenity I use daily is the large grass area behind the complex that we were permitted to use for our dogs. Lately, they decided that because of a report of a flea infestation months ago that through a series of supposed exchanges with the city, we aren\u2019t allowed to use the area any longer and doing so would be a lease violation. Having broken vehicle and pedestrian gates, doors within the community that don\u2019t lock properly, rampant package theft even with the forced use of Fetch package delivery service instead of the onsite lockers we used to use and sketchy vehicle transactions happening in the parking lot don\u2019t seem to be any concern to management. I brought a lot of these security concerns to management on April 6, 2023 and they still haven\u2019t been fixed but keeping my dog out of an area we\u2019ve used for two years is apparently more important.\n\nEDIT (01/08/2024): The security issues still remain but the complex has put a padlock on the gate into the large grass area that we use as an off-leash pet area.  I'm sure they'll say \"it was the city\" but the city isn't going to come out and unlock that gate when the landscapers come.  Stop lying.",

As we have told you and all residents previously, the detention pond and biofiltration system behind Nexus East is City of Austin property, and Nexus East is responsible for landscaping maintenance, pollution control, and ensuring controlled access. It is not - and has never been - a dog park, dog run, or amenity for residents, regardless of what previous management may have incorrectly told you. The City of Austin placed a placard stating that the area is not for public access, and we have locked the gates due to repeated unauthorized resident access to the area. We take our responsibility to the City of Austin seriously, as well as the overall maintenance of Nexus East, which is why the area has been secured. \n\nWith respect to your concerns regarding security, we are working to replace our pedestrian gate locks which have been previously replaced several times this year, and we work on a daily and weekly basis to ensure that the vehicle gates are operating correctly as well as the rest of the access points within the property. \n\nPlease feel free to reach out to us directly regarding your concerns and we will be happy to address them with you further. Thank you for your continued feedback and helping us ensure Nexus East is a comfortable place to live, and we hope to hear from you soon.\n\nNexus East",

          "text": "A Bewildering Experience at Nexus East Apartment Complex.\n\nI am writing this review to express my deep dissatisfaction with Nexus East Apartment Complex. While I initially moved in with high hopes, my experience has been marred by a series of frustrations and disappointments.\n\nFirstly, I've had several issues with the maintenance staff. On multiple occasions, they have entered my apartment without prior notice or while I was not present, which is a gross invasion of my privacy. The lack of respect for the personal space of tenants is extremely troubling.\n\nSecondly, the advertisement of a dog park and water retention park was a major selling point for me. However, this turned out to be false advertising. The so-called \"dog park\" is nothing more than a tiny patch of fake grass, and the \"water retention park\" is now non-existent. This misleading information is not only unethical but also a disservice to potential residents who are making decisions based on these amenities.\n\nLastly, and perhaps most concerning, is the issue with the complex's gates. They are frequently broken and remain open, allowing free access to the property. This lack of security has directly resulted in thefts in the complex. The management has shown little urgency or concern in addressing this significant safety issue.\n\nFurthermore, the customer service at Nexus East is deplorable. The management lacks accountability and has shown little to no interest in resolving the issues we have brought to their attention. Requests and complaints seem to fall on deaf ears, leaving us feeling ignored and undervalued as residents.\n\nIn conclusion, living at Nexus East Apartment Complex has been a frustrating and disappointing experience. The management's lack of regard for tenant rights, false advertisement of amenities, and poor customer service have made my stay here an ordeal. I strongly advise potential renters to consider these issues before choosing to live at Nexus East.",

We would like to discuss your concerns again in detail in person if you would like to have a meeting. As discussed before when requesting a maintenance request or pest control service this is you giving us permission to enter your home. Any other time we may enter you home would be due to required inspections per city requirements such as our Fire Inspections, etc. which we provide advance notices for. \n\nAs we have told you and all residents previously, the detention pond and biofiltration system behind Nexus East is City of Austin property, and Nexus East is responsible for landscaping maintenance, pollution control, and ensuring controlled access.  It is not - and has never been - a dog park, dog run, or amenity for residents, regardless of what previous management may have incorrectly told you. The City of Austin placed a placard stating that the area is not for public access, and we have locked the gates due to repeated unauthorized resident access to the area. We take our responsibility to the City of Austin seriously, as well as the overall maintenance of Nexus East, which is why the area has been secured. \n\nWith respect to your concerns regarding security, we are working to replace our pedestrian gate locks which have been previously replaced several times this year, and we work on a daily and weekly basis to ensure that the vehicle gates are operating correctly as well as the rest of the access points within the property. \n\nPlease feel free to reach out to us directly regarding your concerns and we will be happy to address them with you further. Thank you for your continued feedback and helping us ensure Nexus East is a comfortable place to live, and we hope to hear from you soon.",

          "text": "CHOOSE SOMEWHERE ELSE!\n\nI usually give places the benefit of the doubt, but this was a really awful experience at these apartments. The staff is constantly changing. Some are very nice, but there are some VERY rude members even when you are trying to be polite and cordial.\n\nThe apartments are new, but are very cheaply made. The cabinets and doors are thin and easily broken. The large sinks are not set right so they do not drain and accumulate water and grime. The washing machine sets off the breaker every other time, so if you try doing a was while gone or over night you will find your clothes sitting, submerged in water. Insects and bugs are everywhere. They fill the semi-open air stairwells. The stairwells are NEVER cleaned of trash, spills, or spiderwebs. In 2 bedrooms the AC is near the guest room and gets that room very cold while the rest of the apartment gets no AC. No vent valves to redirect air.\n\nThen there are the Air B&Bers. The apartment puts up its own units on air b&b for extra income. This means that there is a constant flow of travelers who get locked outside, trash the stairwells and hallways, and never put their trash out right so that the trash service won't take it and it will sit there in the hallways with nothing done to it for weeks. They also bring their dogs which have attacked other tenants with no repercussions\n\nFinally, when I moved out they sent me a bill for $1400 owed after deposit. I used a cleaning service, but they charged me with $200 \"Heavy Cleaning\" fee and $750 for new carpet and padding. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the carpet.\n\nThis was one of the most disappointing rental experiences I have ever had. The Nexus is WAYYY over priced for what you get. I would pick the next apartment on your list.",

My daughter has rented here for almost a year now and it has been one problem after another. 2 major floods (she lives on the bottom floor) due to upstairs units having pipe breaks and toilet issues. More often than not she has to live in inhumane conditions such as loud fans for water and mold remediation 24-7, construction work tearing out walls etc. The management wouldn\u2019t pay for a hotel the first time it flooded. second time they offered a smaller apt that is not large enough for their furniture (her and her roommate work from home). Packages are frequently stolen. You will get late fees and eviction notices if the payment portal is down. Pathetic excuse for an apartment complex. Save yourself a lot of headaches and try to find a better managed apartment if you can!",

We take all feedback very seriously here, especially when related to a water leak like this. We have been working since this incident occurred to assist your daughter to the best of our ability and make this right. While we cannot provide you directly with additional details, we are moving her to a larger unit - not a smaller one - for the time being, and she will be able to return to her original unit as requested once repairs are completed.\n\nWe understand that this is a difficult and stressful situation and want the process to move as quickly and smoothly as possible. We welcome you and your daughter to reach out to us at our office regarding further concerns so that we can address them while we work to resolve this and will do what we can to assist. We greatly appreciate your feedback, and it is our goal and intent to make every resident experience here at Nexus East as high-quality as possible, even when incidents like this happen.",

As time has moved on and new management has taken over the building my experience and living situation here has drastically diminished.\n- I have barely had hot water and lacking water pressure at times to my apt going on about two months now\n- I can't turn on my hair dryer with both bathroom lights on without my fuse breaking every single time (have to use dimmed light with only 1 on)\n- the layout in the  1bd has a funky layout where the two bathroom doors collide into each other.\n- this community does NOT provide lock out help outside of business hours. Their response/advice to residents is don't lose or have your property stolen/taken.\n- this is an airbnb heavy community which can raise safety and noise concerns\n- cars have been broken into\n- package rooms have been broken into\n\nHonestly some of these things are whatever and I can deal with and have, but as the list keeps growing they are beginning to snowball and create a horrible living experience that is now starting to impact daily life (NO HOT WATER)",

I applied somewhere else and sent my new address to the property manager on the 12th requesting my refund be sent and received no response.\n\nI called several times at which I was ignored. I then called from a different phone number right after which was prompt answered. The manager tells me that they only send out requests twice a month. This was a new to me, as I asked how long it would take to receive my money back and was told within 14 days and no mention of when it would be requested which to me should have been immediately since it was taking so long to get a decision.\n\nI've contacted their corporate office on my own instead of trusting an email with one person's name because I have absolutely no trust in what I've been told, and am angered by the treatment and holding of my funds. 14 days is up!\nHopefully the management company will follow up.\n\nI only came to this property because I was told they would work with me. This property is barely maintained, trash in the walk ways along with other undesirable elements and have the nerve to keep me waiting as if this is some gem of a property, and is a far far cry from anything such.\n\nThis is my experience getting the runaround with the property manager there, whose name is Richie. I don't know if this is standard business practice for AMC Properties but he is the only one that I have seen at this property so there was no hope for a better experience with any other agent.",

Then aggressively confronted us for calling the cops on his poor choices. Its the weekend before 4th of July and our pool is neon green, Again. Palm Tree seed pods are covering the pool. If this place was maintained properly, They would know Palm Trees need to be trimmed before they start to seed or it can cause bigger problems. 6/19/2023 UPDATE: It\u2019s Monday and Richie can\u2019t seem to answer the phone. SHOCKER! We just passed Father\u2019s Day weekend with a green pool- OUR ONLY AMENITY we pay for looks like shrecks swamp water. We have broken parking lot lights that have been like this for over a month, That could cause serious injury. Talking with a neighbor, Turns out we don\u2019t have a maintenance man either!!!! Pathetic\u2026. Allll these issues and the office manager trots around telling everyone he now lives on property, all while he literally can\u2019t even answer the phone, Nor take care of the property.\n\n11/3/22 UPDATE: Bianca the so called \u201coffice lady\u201d STILL won\u2019t answer the phone NOR follow up with broken appliances. THEY DONT FIX ANYTHING. Can you say GHETTO?  Now owned by a NEW OWNER. We were notified by once again, Changing the requirements of HOW we pay rent, Keep in mind it\u2019s costing extra just TO GET RENT PAID. I am in a Lease, The new company is charging extra. As for Jasmine Womack\u2019s review, You give a place that has ROACHES 3 stars? Ew. Have a higher expectations.\n\nThis property does not value the tenants that reside here. Every month it\u2019s a huge hassle to even pay rent. They keep changing what kind of payment they will accept, with that every month each method has hidden fees. They are essentially pushing us to have no other option than Auto-Pay. I could see using Auto pay if this was a luxury apartment, but we pay for a green pool, no gym or grills & unimaginable dirty property. See pics below for proof. We pay over $1500 a month for a neon green pool.(Dont forget the hidden fees to even pay your rent)  I asked temp office manager as to why we don\u2019t have a gym when there\u2019s been a gym here for over 10 years, What WAS a gym is now turned into a dirty storage room. Bianca the new office manager is quite literally useless. She doesn\u2019t answer numerous phone calls, nor emails I\u2019ve sent.",

I asked for the Admin fee back since a apartment wasn\u2019t going to be held for me anyways and they never called back or refunded me. So I paid $200 for them to call me and say they wouldn\u2019t let me have an apartment unless I paid the rent plus cost of rent for the deposit and never get the admin fee back.

Submitted a request for a scheduled tour on Tuesday over the weekend (they are closed Saturday and Sunday), and started receiving automated promotional emails immediately. Did not hear from staff on Monday or Tuesday, but received an automated email at 7pm on Monday inviting me to tour during their open house \u201ctoday at 1pm!\u201d No dates listed, and I still hadn\u2019t received a response, so I arrived at the office around 1:30pm on Tuesday when I had originally hoped to take a tour. The office manager Richy seemed to immediately recognize me (my emailed request), and knew I was looking for a two bedroom. Explained that he didn\u2019t have a single unit available to tour on the whole property until the next day. I explained that I have a busy work schedule and couldn\u2019t fit anything in until the following week, but was very interested in seeing any unit (even if it wasn\u2019t the layout I was looking to rent). He told me to email him with my availability for the following week, which I did within three hours of leaving the office. It has been over 48 hours and I have not heard anything from the management team. Disappointed, as the property appears to be well maintained and I love the floor plans offered. I\u2019ve lived in dozens of apartments in my life and know that if I can\u2019t get a response from management before I\u2019ve even moved in, there\u2019s no way I\u2019d receive prompt assistance if there were issues during my lease.",

Unfortunately it is not an easy fix and may have to replace the windows entirely, and may take a while. I am not in a rush to get it fixed anyways, since it is still winter. But shout out to Marco for being able to service everything else with ease and was able to address a lot of the issues I had! He was able to fix my ice maker that was completely frozen over!",

There\u2019s a nice gym, co-working space, lounge, courtyard, and rooftop pool / barbecue area, which are all so nice and I use pretty often. The building and garage are also very secure. The only big issues I\u2019ve had have been with the mail system sometimes not letting me access my packages (which has always been fixed by staff) or construction setting off the smoke detectors several times when we first moved in, but I think that has stopped at this point. All the staff here are so friendly and really go above and beyond to welcome you in and solve problems. They also host frequent events, which are great for meeting neighbors and I\u2019ve had fun at every event I\u2019ve been at :)",

The list of problems with this place is ridiculous! There is 4 elevators in this building and you\u2019ll be lucky if they work and if they do work you have a 50/50 chance of getting stuck in them. The hallways smell like trash and covered in dog feces. When the power goes out you better have your own flashlights because there is NO EMERGENCY LIGHTING! I\u2019m convinced that 90% of the reviews are fake because living here and talking to many residents I have yet to find someone who is happy here. I do have to give the staff a shoutout because they do everything they can to help us but they can only do so much! I had to give a 5 star because they won\u2019t post my review if you give anything less than a 5. If you want to see the pictures click on my profile.

He answers my calls promptly and ALWAYS has an upbeat attitude.\n\nThe building itself is great! I have lived in many luxury communities and this one is in the top 3! I love the rooftop pool, the gym, and the bright beautiful windows throughout.\n\nThe maintenance team is very quick to get to the work orders and I appreciate that VERY much! They are kind and very respectful when in your home.\n\nThe neighbors are super kind and I have already made friends with other pet parents! The dog park is a huge plus!\n\nHowever, the reason i can't give out 5 stars is because I am a little disappointed in the access system. In all of the previous communities I have lived in, they ALL have the keypad lock to the unit so it doesn't need a fob or key, just a code. This place is fob only. So therefore I have no way of letting my dog walker come into my unit. I do understand they use the Butterfly MX to get into the building but it is essentially useless without being able to get into my unit. This is not luxury at all. If I am ever locked out of my unit due to not having my fob, I have to pay for an emergency maintenance request. I also am disappointed in not having a filtered fridge when every unit i toured did have one so I felt let down on that as well.\n\nOverall, I am super happy to call this place my new home. I have loved it so far. You can't hear your neighbors or the hospital noise at all. I just wish it was truly luxury with a keypad lock instead of fob access to your unit. I do highly recommend this place though!! :)",

Also, I didn't make a post on 5/24/23 as I was still on my current lease (moved in February 2023 and moved out August 2024). My post was after my lease. Believe all of the bad reviews that they let you see and the ones that they don't. The Curate Complex amenities are amazing (apartment layout, gym, rooftop lounges, and views) and that's it. Parking sucked (sometimes I had to park by the AMC movie theater and one time my car got towed, they said that we could park there, but you're subject to tow; also other apartment complexes, especially the one across the street, their residents were parking at our complex and walking across the street to their apartment as well as the apartments next door; even though a few months later, Curate, implemented parking rules (registration), I didn't notice any differences and didn't see one car towed. Every one should have had a designed parking spot, but they couldn't do that because they know that there's more apartments, than parking spaces and they basically said if you want that, you need to buy a carport or garage, which could be upwards of $200 or more, which is ridiculous) pool rules were horrible (never got to use it, due to what others have said about it), elevators were down for several months (handicapped people were struggling going up all of those floors), several of my packages were stolen (sometimes it came to my apartment, sometimes in went in my building mail room, sometimes it went in the kiosk, and if it went in the mail room in the Office Building (good luck because people were taking packages off of the shelves and even with cameras right there, they couldn't prove who packages wasn't yours). I have OCD and cleaned my apartment 3X better than the condition that I received my apartment and they stood my deposit because I decided not to use their Spruce company to clean. Every month they kept sending me an email for their services. If you're deciding to move out and don't use a professional company or their Spruce, they won't give you your deposit back, even if your apartment was left better than you received it. They will tell you that they kept your deposit because they had to clean your apartment i.e. using their paid workers (Spruce) to clean the apartment anyways. Complete frauds. Also, my lease was up on Sunday, and they don't work on Sundays, so they charged me an extra day. I was like, how was I supposed to turn in my keys on a day that your Office isn't open. I didn't intend to write this post, but since they decided to send me an email that they deleted it, I'll just write another one, with specific details and examples like the other previous tenants. You probably won't see this post either because it'll probably get deleted too...It went downhill when the Office manager transferred to another property. I can't remember her name, but I wish I did.",

          "text": "This is easily the worst experience I\u2019ve ever had with a rental property. I went to tour the place about a month ago with one of the leasing agents named Ross. The building was not luxurious by any means and had a ton of flaws, but I did like the location, so I decided to go with it. I got absolutely no follow up after the tour. I gave him the benefit of the doubt thinking he\u2019s busy and I ended up applying for the apartment against my better judgement. I still didn\u2019t hear back from them. I now have been trying to cancel my application and get my money back, and they have not even had the courtesy to reply. This is not the type of communication or treatment I\u2019d expect from any rental property let alone a \u201cluxury\u201d one.",

From the moment we walked in, the staff made everything feel effortless\u2014welcoming, helpful, and just overall wonderful.\n\nEven though this isn\u2019t an event venue, the entire day was so smooth and well-organized that you\u2019d think it was. Abby (I think that was her name?) handled everything like a pro, a super helpful guy was running around making sure we had whatever we needed, and the woman at the front desk was amazing\u2014she even helped us find a great local restaurant afterward.\n\nThe building itself is beautiful, spotlessly clean, and in an awesome location, but what really stood out was how genuinely kind and attentive everyone was. If this is what it\u2019s like just visiting, I can only imagine how great it must be to live there. If I weren\u2019t moving out of state, I\u2019d 100% consider it!\n\nHuge thanks to the team at The Confluence for making an already special day even better.

I set an app't online and rec'd no app't confirmation. I then rec'd a call the next day they had double booked me and could I reschedule. I said I had a 2PM and 4PM app't. She said, how is 3?  I said great.  I showed up about 3:02PM.  I was kindly asked to wait for Ross.  I was offered water or coffee (nice!).  And I waited.  And waited. After about 15 min of no sign of Ross I politely advised I was leaving.  Receptionist was very kind. And that was it.  I went back and checked email and I had rec'd a confirmation for a 2PM app't that I didn't see as I was in tours all day.  Well, I guess if the scheduling and Leasing Agent attitudes were broken, probably not the best place for me.\n\nNote:  The desk staff is lovely.  After I left I realized I had lost an earring.  I called Confluence's desk and they looked for it and called me when they found it.  Wonderful!",

When they finally came on October 23rd to \u201crecharge\u201d the system, it still didn\u2019t work and continued blowing warm air.\n\nCommunication throughout this process has been frustrating and unhelpful. Maintenance blamed the weather being \u201ctoo cold\u201d outside for the repair, but if that\u2019s the case, why wasn\u2019t this addressed when the issue was first reported \u2014 when temperatures were still warm?\n\nIn the meantime, they gave us a portable A/C unit which barely cools the bedroom and looks terrible sitting in the living space. For what this complex charges in rent and \u201cluxury\u201d fees, basic climate control should not be an issue.\n\nBetween the lack of urgency, poor explanations, and feeling ignored as a resident, I absolutely cannot recommend this place. Paying full rent while going weeks without proper A/C is unacceptable.",

We waited for over a half hour past when our appointment was scheduled. At no time did anyone enter the leasing office, open the door, or call us back. BEWARE this is a terribly run building. Look elsewhere around the area. Many buildings with more respectful people working behind the counter who understand some people need to take time off of work to schedule a tour.",

We\u2019ve lived in Edison at rhino for almost a year our neighbors called animal control on our dogs for barking when we were at work working and continue to harass us when we have not done ANYTHING to them. Our neighbors above us are also very noisy as well and we\u2019ve not said a word or made a complaint. They have proceeded to mess with our rent prices but want to kiss ass and make excuses when addressed directly to their faces. A girl that was previously living here was pregnant and struggling to pay her rent and they put all her things out for people to get when they have a whole trash garage that they could\u2019ve stored her stuff for her to come and get (I will pictures at the bottom to clarify.) The prices are expensive and it\u2019s not even worth living around when people get stabbed downtown and you\u2019re constantly being invaded by people. The elevator doesn\u2019t even work sometimes and if it does you have to wait 10 minutes to get on it. There was also a girl living here with her boyfriend, and they proceeded to add drama into the relationship, causing them to break up. Do not let them know your business or what you have going on or they will do everything to start drama to make a show out of it for other residents. Honestly you\u2019re better off getting a bigger apartment and something more peaceful. DO NOT APPLY A APPLICATION HERE THEY WILL RIG YOU.(if you do apply an application, make sure to ask the neighbors and the apartment complex they\u2019re experience of living here.)",

If you\u2019re a single woman with a pet, make sure you have a concealed carry permit before you sign your lease because you will be harassed and attacked by homeless people from the shelter next door on a daily basis.\n\nThe Edison has done a great job at hiring a customer centric staff to handle the first point of contact, initial walkthroughs, and any questions you may have about the property. These folks are very kind and friendly and they give you a warm fuzzy feeling about the Edison. Unfortunately, these are the same people you will be interfacing with when the garage is broke for months on end, or the elevators don\u2019t work, or homeless people are smoking fentanyl in the stairwell you have to walk through to take your dog out because the elevators are broken. They maintain that same bubbly personality that drew you in initially while they unfortunately can\u2019t resolve any of your issues because they\u2019ve been trained to defer accountability to any and everyone but the Edison. The level of support they provide when you need a new home and haven\u2019t signed a contract isn\u2019t the same support you\u2019ll get when the garage is broke for 6 months. Hard to tell if the fecal matter in the halls is from vagrants or peoples pets, but don\u2019t stress\u2026. The office staff will make sure the tour they give you bypasses all those stains while covertly navigating you around the stairwells will holes in the drywall and homeless people sleeping in stairwells. You will conveniently find cameras in common areas, but when you need surveillance footage from the \u201csecured parking\u201d area where all your windows are shattered in your paid parking spot, they won\u2019t be able to assist. You\u2019ll be guaranteed a new flyer with monthly activities (that are often misleading) and a cutesy pet of the month posting, but you might not be able to access your Amazon packages that were delivered 3 days ago while you were out of town because the package room was vandalized and they had to relocate everything until a contractor could correct the problem. This building isn\u2019t brand new, so you won\u2019t have to deal with the frustration of on site security and trash services being cut after you move in that were major reasons you signed a lease to begin with. The staff all have nice smiles, but are basically useless after you move in. They may greet you daily, but they don\u2019t know how to resolve the faulty lighting fixture that\u2019s been pulsing for months by the trash chute, but be reassured when you ask about the status of your complaint you will be reassured it\u2019s a part on back order, not a maintenance issue.\n\nIf youre looking for adult dorms and an $1800 dollar studio with a bubbly staff that doesn\u2019t know how to resolve actual issues but has a charming smile, this might be the place for you. If you prefer working elevators and secure parking look elsewhere, but if you want a front desk person with a nice smile and 0 follow though on any actual issues, this is the place for you.\n\nAnd if youre looking for parking in the winter, avoid the water and poop drains overhead in the garage. They will burst and if you\u2019re parked underneath, well that\u2019s your problem.\n\nWith rents dropping across Denver, do your homework. You\u2019ll be happier with a brand new building that hasn\u2019t stripped all the amenities they needed to occupy the building initially. Also, watch out for the sketchy renewal that you\u2019ll get at the end of your initial lease and put some holes in those walls too, because they aren\u2019t returning your security deposit.",

Natalie and Nevaeh are the best leasing consultants any company could ever ask for. They're so polite and helpful, they literally will solve any problem that seems to arise. Natalie really brightens up the Edison, she's so fun to talk to and has the best sense of humor. I love the events that are constantly going on at the Edison, there's always have something fun where the residents and staff can interact with each other. I also love all of the amenities, I love grilling my food with a beautiful view of the city.. If an issue ever arises, maintenance has never hesitated to come and fix something. 10/10 living experience.",

The apartments are great and reasonably priced, the amenities are also very nice, and the staff is always super friendly (shoutout to Ben specifically). The location is absolutely stellar. About a 10 minute walk to Coors Field and there are great restaurants, bars, and breweries all within walking distance. The cherry on top though is that the staff does several events every month that are actually pretty awesome. For Oktoberfest they were handing out free beer, they\u2019ve had several nights where they bring in a bartender for free cocktails, an event where you could trade random items with other residents if you wanted, different things for pets, etc. It is awesome. Just wanted to give this place the recognition it deserves.",

The pool is so pretty, very instagrammable, packages and mail are always secure, dog friendly building and walkable to a brand new dog park and sport court one block down. Grills and fire pits are always working and the leasing team puts in so much effort in fostering local relationships so we get discounts and perks at local hot spots. For example, free pancake day from snooze in the lobby, happy hour for residents at neighborhood bars and even hotel partnerships for when your family visits!! I  moved from out of state and had to find a place remotely and I\u2019m so grateful I made the right decision. Living here is really best case scenario for wanting to live near hustle bustle but not right downtown, having a walking path right next to the river to enjoy beautiful Colorado days, walkable new clean dog park, and honestly a dorm feel because everyone is so friendly. The leasing office has made an amazing community here. 10/10 recommend",

Thanks !\nI have only an issue about our METERGY bills. We're been overly charged since the beginning. We were told that the utilities would be around 80,100 ,120 the most for 2 people but since the 1st month was 190 and never came down, even going higher as 200.  I was away for a whole month, my husband works 14 to 15 hours daily, doesn't cook,  even though the usage kept the same. I complained 3 times, they asked to send a copy of my bills what I did but I never had any response about what's going on. I compared my bill with other couple they have almost a same usage as us and they're bill is about 50 dollars less than ours monthly. We are very annoyed by that. This experience is us very uncomfortable. I sent again, as requested,  for the third time my January bill of 202, 00cad to see if they find a mystery on this . Hope the management  can help us to fix this issue.",

They truly made the entire move-in experience much less stressful.\n\nThe concierge team downstairs is fantastic. From the very first day, they\u2019ve been welcoming, friendly, and always eager to assist. It makes returning home feel warm and effortless, which I genuinely appreciate.\n\nThe maintenance team has also been excellent. I submitted a work order recently, and it was completed in just 1-2 hours, even on the weekend! That kind of prompt response is uncommon and definitely gives me peace of mind. It might help that the building is currently only about 35% occupied, but regardless, it demonstrates that they take requests seriously and act quickly.\n\nPablo was nice and excellent at completing my tasks at the apt!",

Check metergy reviews and on google you'll know what I am talking about.\nWith an already expensive building to live in metergy puts on an added pressure of what your utilities might be.\nWhen we visited sloane we were told that our utilities will be around $100 mark but it has never been the case, our utilities for 1 bed have been considerably higher around $200 while we were not using any HVAC. Escalating issue to management of sloane didn't help resolve the issue. It was always we are working on it etc etc and never got any satisfactory response.\nThis experience kind of puts overall living experience at sloane a little stressful as you might not know what will be thrown at your face by the utilities provider.\nI think sloane must bear responsibility of this since they chose metergy I didn't.\nWhile we love the building, we are not comfortable with this metergy situation because when we moved here we solely based our decision based on what was told to us about utilities.\nIn my opinion, if you are unable to bear the constant mystery of what your utilities be, I don't think sloane is a good option for you but if that is not an issue, then it is the best building to be in.",

When they say they\u2019re elevating rental living, they mean it\u2014bringing hotel living to life (it really does feel like the Tipton for any Family Channel friends!). Tas, our leasing agent, was so kind and accommodating and patient with updates my partner and I had.\nOur concierge team: Priya, Lindsey, Mariam, Nina, Bereket, Yikanu, Jasmine\u2026everyone has contributed to this elevated living experience. Their attention to detail and effort to bring luxury living to residents has come to fruition. Maintenance request? The team has responded to it immediately. Housekeeping team? Always friendly, smiling, and considerate. Security team? We always see them and they\u2019re around supporting the safety of the building.\nAs much as I want to protect this little corner of the rental world, I cannot stop shouting from the rooftops of how blessed we have been to land a home at Sloane.",

          "text": "I officially moved into Sloane on August 31st, and honestly, I couldn\u2019t be happier with my decision. But before I talk about my move-in experience, I want to take it back to the very beginning\u2014when I first showed interest in making Sloane my new home.\nI discovered Ruby, the leasing agent, on TikTok, and from that very first interaction, I could tell she was going to make the whole process easy and smooth. Ruby has been nothing short of amazing\u2014kind, patient, understanding, and incredibly helpful every step of the way.\nShe took her time during my tour, never rushed me, and made sure I understood everything about the lease agreements and the building. What stood out to me the most is that Ruby went above and beyond\u2014she even helped me measure the rooms in my apartment so I wouldn\u2019t have to make an extra trip. That little act of care saved me time and stress, and it showed how thoughtful she truly is. Even after I officially moved in, Ruby continued to check in on me, which made me feel welcomed and cared for. Talking to her feels familiar and genuine, like chatting with a friend. Ruby, you are a gem, and I\u2019m so grateful for everything you\u2019ve done!\nMoving in can sometimes feel overwhelming, but thanks to the maintenance team, the process was so much smoother than I expected. Jonathan, in particular, was an absolute lifesaver. He helped me with so many things around my apartment during my move-in. He always checked in with me, asked if there was anything I needed mounted or adjusted, and never hesitated to go the extra mile. His patience and kindness really stood out to me. Having someone like Jonathan as part of the Sloane team truly made such a difference\u2014it felt like I had extra support during a time that can usually feel so stressful.\nI also want to thank Pablo and Iqram for their help with mounting my TVs. They came right on time, handled everything so professionally, and made sure I didn\u2019t have to worry about a thing. Their efficiency and friendliness didn\u2019t go unnoticed\u2014I really appreciated it.\nPriya has also been a huge help since day one. She is incredible at what she does\u2014you would think she\u2019s been working at Sloane for years with the way she effortlessly handles situations and finds solutions. She\u2019s always available when I need help, always communicates clearly, and makes sure everything is handled smoothly. Priya has truly made a difference in my move-in experience, and I can\u2019t thank her enough.\nNow, the concierge team\u2014what can I say? They are truly the heart of this building. Mariam, Lindsey, Nina, and Bareket are the warmest, most welcoming people. From the very beginning, they\u2019ve gone out of their way to make me feel at home. They don\u2019t just greet me at the desk\u2014they check in, offer help with heavy items, and are always happy to stop for a conversation. I\u2019m usually not someone who enjoys small talk, but with them, it\u2019s different. They\u2019re genuine, funny, and enthusiastic, and chatting with them honestly brightens my day. It\u2019s rare to find people in this industry who bring such warmth and authenticity to their role, and they make Sloane feel more than just a building\u2014it feels like home.\nSecurity also deserves recognition. Knowing there\u2019s always a friendly, welcoming team present 24/7 gives me so much peace of mind. They are approachable, professional, and reassuring, which adds an extra layer of comfort and safety to living here.\nTo wrap everything up, I just want to say how much I truly love living at Sloane. The building itself is beautiful, but what really makes this place stand out is the people. From the leasing process to move-in and now settling into daily life, the staff here have made all the difference. They treat residents with kindness, patience, and respect, and that\u2019s something you can\u2019t always find.\nIf you\u2019re considering moving into Sloane and have any doubts or second thoughts, this place is worth it. Not only will you find a beautiful space to live in, but you\u2019ll also find a community of people who genuinely care. I\u2019m so grateful to call Sloane home, and I couldn\u2019t recommend it more highly.",

          "text": "Moved into my unit in October '25 and I have nothing but wonderful things to say about my entire experience so far!\n\nDuring my initial tour, Patrick was just wonderful to work with! He answered all my questions and helped me apply on the spot. Before move-in, Patrick, Micaela, and Joshua in the front office allowed me to move my move-in date with no issues and rushed to clean my unit after the old tenant moved out so it was in great shape for me to move-in. It was such a great experience i even extended my lease before move-in day! The garage is gated and i've yet to see the gate break down (my old complex had gate issues every other day), there's plenty of parking, and I've seen private security walking the garage overnight!\n\nSince I've moved in, i've had a couple maintenance \"issues\" (regular apartment stuff) that the maintenance team has gone ABOVE & BEYOND for! My requests are reviewed same-day and either resolved or addressed by the next day. Amir is responsive, knowledgeable, and exactly who you want to help you with any surprise maintenance needs! Just, the best!\n\nThe *only* thing I'll say to be aware of is if you're living on the east side or close to downtown, you have to be prepared for some acts of vandalism (as you do in most cities). There's only been one instance of vandalism in our garage since my move-in but even then, the front office team handled it wonderfully! They sent out an email alerting tenants, immediately hired daytime security, and even helped my friend check on my car as I was out of town when this occurred.\n\nA long review to say, i would definitely recommend living here or anywhere this team manages! Thank you!",

Recently, my entire sink collapsed unexpectedly, and the maintenance team handled the situation with urgency and professionalism. Amir came by the very next day to assess the issue and immediately coordinated a contractor to get everything repaired.\n\nNot only did they install a brand-new sink, but they also replaced the entire floor in the area which had a bit of water damage, and the work was done quickly and with great attention to detail. Throughout the whole process, Amir checked in, communicated clearly, and made sure everything was resolved to a high standard.\n\nThe level of service here has always been consistent, and this experience is just another example of why I\u2019ve chosen to stay at 7East for so long. Big shoutout to Amir for going above and beyond. His professionalism, kindness, and follow-through truly make a difference. Highly recommend living here!",

Also when you need maintenance done, they do not replace or fix things with what you had before.  We are supposed to have smart switches but mine went out and they replaced it with a regular switch.  This can be a small issue but when you are charge an internet/smart package it becomes an issue.  You are paying for a service that as time goes buy you are not able to use anymore.  Why have an app when you cannot manage your lights.  Only thing it\u2019s good for is to open your door without having to use your key.\nI will be looking for a new place to live.  I love my apt but with this new management it has made it hard to live here.",

The walls are extremely thin \u2014 I could hear footsteps from the room above throughout the day and night, and every night around midnight, someone in the hallway had loud phone conversations that continued despite me asking them to lower their voice.\n\nRoad noise is constant, and the view from my room was of a vacant parking lot that felt unsafe, with visible signs of homelessness and people sleeping on the pavement. The adjacent 7-Eleven has a flashing blue security light and a voice-activated \u201cno loitering\u201d announcement that goes off frequently, adding to the discomfort.\n\nThe room itself was passable but felt cheaply furnished. I had looked forward to relaxing by the pool, but the hot tub jets didn\u2019t work, the furniture was dirty and neglected, and the main pool had visible dirt at the bottom \u2014 clearly not maintained regularly.\n\nI\u2019ve included photos to show the reality, which is far from what the listing portrayed. I travel to Salt Lake City often for work and had hoped this could be a go-to spot for future stays, but based on this experience, I won\u2019t be returning.",

          "text": "After living here for a year I am shocked that this apartment complex doesn\u2019t have more bad reviews. I can only assume it wasn\u2019t always this bad. I\u2019ve lived in lots of similar style apartments complex\u2019s and while they all have their issues I have never lived somewhere with this many problems. I rely a lot on reviews when looking for apartments so here\u2019s some things I wish I would\u2019ve been aware of prior to signing a lease.\n\n- Be sure to ask for your actual total monthly fees. My one bedroom was about $450 more than the listed rent with all fees included. (This does not include utilities)\n- The shared spaces are often not maintained and unusable. (A glass table top from the courtyard flew into my window and shattered I promptly alerted the staff and was ignored. 8 months later the courtyard was still covered in shattered glass, you\u2019ll pay a fee for the package room but it will rarely be in working order, the coffee machine is also not maintained and usually doesn\u2019t actually have any coffee in it)\n- The hallways smell ungodly bad most of the time and valet trash is so particular that it\u2019s easier to just take out your own trash even though you\u2019re paying for valet.\n- Lots of the units are Airbnbs making it feel like living in a hotel. I was constantly getting approached by vacationers who are lost or locked out or can\u2019t figure out parking.\n- My sink and shower were constantly clogged and I had to keep fixing it myself because maintenance never came.\n- They seem to have intermittent issues with the fire alarms because they will go off for seemingly no reason and stay on for long periods of time.\n- Police don\u2019t have access to the building which became a problem when physical fights are happening in the hallway.\n- They hand out evictions like candy. In my 1 year there 3 of the units in my hall alone received eviction notices myself included. My autopay bounced once due to some fraud on my account. I didn\u2019t receive any kind of notice that it didn\u2019t go through and when I logged onto my portal it said the payment was processed. 3 days later I received an eviction notice along side some hefty fees. The staff didn\u2019t contact me directly when the payment bounced and was incredibly unprofessional when handling this situation.\n- The key fob system once broke leaving me locked out of my apartment for an entire day.\n- My last month there was only a few days and instead of charging me the $200 prorated amount that I was supposed to pay they charged me 2k and took over a month to refund my money.\n- Upon move out they do charge you for additional cleaning even if you leave the apartment cleaner than when you moved in and definitely don\u2019t hang anything on your walls unless you don\u2019t need your deposit back.\n\nThe units themselves are pretty nice but not worth the stress and there\u2019s other comparable apartments around that are managed much better.",

The first year I lived here everything was great and would have given it four or five stars. The second year is when staff and management changed in the office frequently. Gabriel has always been great to work with and has been helpful, but other staff not so much. The valet trash is picky with the type and size of bags you use. The gym has good options but the equipment is rarely cleaned. The elevators usually have dirty floors and haven\u2019t been cleaned as frequently as they used to. The hallways have air fresheners all around to cover over any odors, which is almost too strong and causes me to sneeze. The pool, hot tub, gym, and the clubhouse were pros to living here. The hot tub rarely ever has been closed. The maintenance team here is amazing and responsive. They respond to requests within 24 hours or so. Unfortunately, just like any other apartment, you can hear your neighbors walking above you and you can hear your downstairs neighbors when they blast music after hours. The leasing office ignored the email I sent them about loud music after hours and I had to deal with it until I moved out. There are a lot of airbnbs in this complex as well. When I moved into my apartment, it was not deep cleaned and I had to clean it myself to how I wanted. I had a clogged bathroom sink when I moved in. When I moved out, I made sure to deep clean my apartment to make sure I wasn\u2019t charged for anything. When I got my deposit back, they only gave us 1/4 back from our deposit due to cleaning and painting. When I emailed the office regarding this, they did not respond or give any further explanation. I give block44 2.5 stars but I\u2019ll be generous and give them 3.",

Like any luxury complex, there are always the highs and lows. I would have to say under the new management of Kairoi the apartment complex has undergone many great improvements. From an increase in community events, to maintaining communication with residents, and improved maintenance. Overall residents are friendly and welcoming easy to converse and get to know or simply say hello to.  Great community structure all around.",

It\u2019s so nice to live in a building that is well-maintained and respected. All of the residents who live near me are friendly, quiet, and respectful.

From day one, the staff has been genuinely helpful and easy to work with\u2014especially Duncan and Wyatt. They made the move-in process smooth, answered every question we had, and have continued to be super responsive any time we need anything.\n\nThe building itself feels clean, well cared for, and the design/decor is modern without trying too hard\u2014really comfortable and welcoming. The amenities have been a huge bonus too. The common areas are great for relaxing (TV lounges, firepits, and plenty of seating), and having BBQ grills, a pool and hot tub, plus a solid fitness center makes it feel like you\u2019re getting perks you\u2019ll actually use\u2014not just \u201cnice on paper.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve also been impressed with maintenance. They\u2019ve been quick to fix things and communication has been clear the whole time. It\u2019s always easy to get ahold of the team, which is honestly rare these days.\n\nLocation-wise, it\u2019s hard to beat\u2014close to Temple Square and all the downtown Salt Lake attractions. And inside the apartment, it\u2019s surprisingly quiet. We feel safe here and really happy with our choice. Highly recommend Harvest if you\u2019re looking for a clean, modern place with great staff and amenities.",

The master room\u2019s window is so thin it feels like it\u2019s open, street noise and drafts come right through. Around 6 a.m. a constant tapping started, which I believe are the pipes, and it hasn\u2019t stopped (currently 0920). To top everything off the AC sounds like a vacuum.\n\nDuncan was a great salesman and very helpful, so I\u2019d give him 5 stars but the unit\u2019s overall quality is far below what I expected. I\u2019m not looking forward to spending a year in this maddeningly noisy room.",

          "text": "Think twice before renting any property managed by Greystar\n\nI rented an apartment here last year.  The place was okay.  But there are a few things you should be aware of before you rent.\n\n1) The management company is facing several class action lawsuits for deceptive business practices, one in Colorado and one in California.  The cost to rent is not what they tell you upfront.  I noticed a discrepancy myself.  At first I thought it was just a miscommunication but I found out there is litigation against them in two different states for misleading renters about the cost.\n\n\"Class Action Lawsuit: In April 2025, a class action lawsuit was filed against Greystar in California federal court, alleging similar deceptive practices and violation of various state and federal consumer laws. This lawsuit specifically claims that Greystar charges illegal fees for services like pest control and trash that should be part of the rent.\"\n\n2) Noise!  I had a very difficult time sleeping because the noise of traffic and motorcycles going by the building at night would keep me up.\n\nSo, in summary, expect the actual cost to rent to be greater than the quoted cost, and don't expect to sleep well if you are a light sleeper.",

The recent management transition at Harvest was part of a rapid industry-standard process, which unfortunately can lead to brief gaps in online systems. As the previous management\u2019s portal was deactivated, and our new systems were not yet live, we required a one-time physical payment by check or money order to ensure rent could still be processed on time. We understand this was inconvenient \u2014 especially for residents who were traveling or had autopay set up. During this time, our office phone systems (marketing phone number) and resident portal were also updated, and we encouraged all communication via email to create a clear paper trail and ensure all resident inquiries were addressed in order of receipt. This process helped us manage a high volume of questions and ledger verifications efficiently and fairly. We absolutely understand that no one wants to jump through hoops to pay rent \u2014 and that\u2019s never our goal. Now that our systems are fully live, we\u2019re committed to making rent payment and communication as seamless as possible going forward. Thank you for your patience as we continue improving your experience at Harvest. If you're still having trouble accessing the portal or need assistance, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to our team via email and we\u2019ll be happy to help.",

The new management property did post flyers with information on our doors and I did see them doing a sort of inspection - I hope they are better than Greystar.  We as tenants are in limbo waiting to see how we pay rent, call maintenance, security, etc..very unprofessional of the greystar management company.  The insulation in apartments is almost nonexistent- the heater makes the pipes make cracking noises all night,  the pool hours are not supervised at all, and security rarely comes if called.  The apartment is ok but Not worth the price.  They definitely appear to be nice during the tours but once you live in them the discrepancies become apparent- just a fyi-",

          "text": "*Update from 5 star to 2 star: This is the 3rd time our heat has gone out and I've woken up to a sub 60 degree apartment... all in the Winter months. These also tend to not be quick repairs despite falling under \"emergency maintenance\" in my eyes. I figured something as serious as heat not working would be more of a priority in winter. We've gone entire weekends without heat due to faulty repairs; for example, Heat went out Friday Jan 31st. Maintenance repairs heat same day, but it goes out after they leave, only to not be fully repaired until the following Monday, February 3rd. To make matters worse, any heaters we plug in to alleviate the issue tend to cause our circuit breaker to trip (which is an electrical fire hazard alone). I have been patient with this issue, but it is unacceptable to have not repaired this by now. Considering how much we pay in rent, a prorated month would be appreciated for the substantially lowered quality of life.\n\nDaniel and Mark were absolutely fantastic in helping with our leasing questions and for move in - thus far, the management team have been incredibly welcoming, knowledgeable, and easy to work with. We've lived at two Greystar properties now, and both were managed very well.\n\nThe units are modern, spacious, and have good appliances. I do wish there was better sound insulation for the price we pay, but noise is to be expected on a main road - we've found that having some form of background noise effectively blocks most vehicle noise. The property seems to have great amenities, but we haven't had the chance to take advantage of them yet. However, we have explored the area quite a bit, and this location is awesome! Walking distance to so much - you certainly won't be bored!",

Our apartment isn\u2019t well-insulated, so we constantly hear loud vehicle noises from outside, making it difficult to sleep at night.\n\nInteractions with management have been particularly frustrating, especially with Laura, the head manager. She\u2019s been rude and dismissive whenever I\u2019ve tried to discuss issues, such as an unexpected $250 fine due to problems with their auto-bill system. I tried to work something out regarding this fee, but she was completely uncooperative and, frankly, unpleasant about it. In one instance, she even made disrespectful remarks in Spanish, assuming I wouldn\u2019t understand\u2014I\u2019m from South America. This happened when I repeatedly asked her to fix a broken storage door so I could access my storage unit, but despite my efforts, the issue was never resolved.\n\nThe rent policies are also quite harsh, with hefty fines if payment isn\u2019t made within three days. To make matters worse, my car was towed over a miscommunication, despite my plates being up-to-date, because the towing company didn\u2019t properly check my information.\n\nThe only positives have been the maintenance team, especially Brian and Nestor, who have consistently been helpful, and Maddie in management, who has a friendly and upbeat attitude. However, these few bright spots don\u2019t make up for the negative experiences. I\u2019ll be moving out as soon as possible and would only recommend this complex if significant improvements are made.",

The location is convenient, with easy access to the freeway and nearby coffee shops. However, while the property is marketed as \u2018luxury,\u2019 it feels more like a nice, standard apartment complex. The amenities are basic, and the \u2018luxury\u2019 label seems to come from the fact that the complex is new, rather than offering any truly upscale features.\n\nMy biggest issue was with the management. I found the property manager to be unprofessional during a disagreement about my lease, and she even hung up on me during a phone call. When I moved out, I was shocked by the unreasonable charges listed on the move-out checklist. Despite being told I would receive my remaining deposit within 14 days, it\u2019s now been over a month, and I just received an email with instructions on how to get my deposit back.\n\nOn a positive note, the maintenance team was great, and Maddie was always pleasant to work with.

Give all these bribed tenants leaving 5 stars a few months dealing with this place and watch their reviews disappear or turn sour.\n\nEdit: if you need any more convincing this complex doesn\u2019t care about its tenants\u2026.they moved an elderly man into this unit when I moved out. Yes this exact one here in the photos. I can almost guarantee you, they fixed nothing. So\u2026they put an elderly man in a home THEY KNOW won\u2019t quit flooding, has no AC, and has pest problems. Keep the elderly away from here unless you want this to be their potential final home. This place is hazardous\u2026.i worry about that man a lot in the upcoming summer knowing there was one point my unit got up to almost 90 inside. But hey, at least he has a window unit thanks to all the fighting I did with the office, right? Keeps it down to 80 degrees in there \ud83e\udd28\n\nFor just $1095 a month (only $13,140 a year!), you can rent one of these beautiful units with these cool new water features they\u2019re offering as of Christmas Eve!!! 9 entire days of all the water I could ask for flooding the lobby and seeping up through my floors! At least one of these lucky ground floor units is listed for this exact building as available and ready to move into right now!!!! It seems the staff is set on keeping partially aquatic buildings for the unforseeable future!!! Perfect for amphibious beings!!! And the water is likely running off the mice and roaches! Two birds, one stone! The water in THIS building keeps out the squatters, so it\u2019s winning all around. Plus the office is very hands off and won\u2019t intrude on your business even when you call the repeatedly! Definitely not a nosy landlord situation!\n\nAnd if you DON\u2019T like the water features then by summer it likely won\u2019t be an issue since most units come WITHOUT one of those pesky working AC units. Everything will may be dry by then at this rate!\n\nOpe sorry! Just realized rent prices went up from when I signed my lease! Dont forget to plan for the $70 water charge and required renters insurance when you calculate your rent cost!\n\nEDIT: turns out the hack to getting a reply is by leaving a review! They replied to my review, but none of the messages or requests I sent! Stellar service!",

Shon) Since I Moved In, They Hadn't Kept Up With The Maintenance Requests &Now Theyre Trying To Charge Me For Stuff That Was In A Maintenance Log When I Moved In - It Was Just All Cleared So They Could Cover Themselves &Make It Seem Like They Were Doing Their Job When They Simply Weren't; i.e. Marking Requests As \"Done\", Even When They Weren't. I Have Been Here Without A.C. For 1 Year &11Months.  No One Checked On It Because They Claim The Maintenance Request Wasnt Documented. They Change Staff More Than People Renting Here. The Mice Are JUST ENOUGH To Make You Want To Break Your Lease Or Even Skip Out On The Rent. The Roaches, They Dont Really Care For - All They Do Is Schedule Pest Control Companies To Come Out &Spray &That's It. They Dont Care To Caulk The Cracks Where The Roaches Are Coming Out Of. I Moved Out In October Of 2025. I Would Post Pictures, But I Believe This Statement Will Say It All: If You Have A Voucher Or On H.U.D., DO NOT MOVE HERE! They Kicked Everybody Out Who Had A Balance (Even As Low As $400) Simply Because OHFA Is Not Gonna Play That Game Of Non-Habitable Situations. They Have Low Occupancy &Everyone Still There Are Simply Waiting Til Their Leases Are Up To Simply Leave &Write Reviews Afterwards. Dont Let Their Kindness Fool You - Everybody Thinks Chimpanzees Are Cute Until You Find Out What They Can Do To You. (Just Saying). The People In The Office Claim They Dont Have Corporates Number, When They Do. Just Go Watch NEWS CHANNEL 4 KFOR On Google. You're Welcome.",

I love having the covered parking, and the amenities are lovely and well kept. I use the fitness center most often and appreciate the diversity in equipment, though it could stand to lose the egregiously heavy free weights(literally no one uses those) and add multiple lighter weights(5s - 20s). The down sides are the ever so occurring fire alarm that goes off at night, and the inescapable valet trash monthly charge. Overall I believe the positives of this apartment complex outweigh the few issues\u2026 though that fire alarm has slowly been challenging my positive opinion. Regardless, I\u2019d absolutely recommend living here!",

The location is fantastic (with the mountain views and pond), and the amenities and management are great too. The only significant downside, as I'm sure many residents are quick to mention, is the fire alarm problem. Every couple months, especially in the winter (and usually in the dead of night), the building-wide fire alarm goes off and forces everyone to wait outside in the cold. It's always a false alarm, and it seems like a problem that's been happening for years and seems will never be fixed. It sucks. But don't want to overstate the downside - all in all, we've been been very happy and have no plans to move anytime soon.",

For one, the sidewalks by the entrances are filthy and smell like dog pee, and they\u2019ve never power washed or cleaned in over a year and a half living here. Also, it costs extra money per month to get into the garage. However, they recently added more reserved spots (extra $$ on top of just getting into the garage, and takes spots that I can use) and now I can\u2019t get a spot in the garage even though I pay monthly for it even though all the reserved spots are empty. This is ridiculous and I wouldn\u2019t recommend this complex to anyone who doesn\u2019t want to be exploited for less than the bare minimum.

I see Olga the unstoppable cleaning machine working hard to keep the common areas looking good despite some of our sloppy residents and she's always friendly to the residents and their pets in the hallways. Brad has been a great manager to talk to about any challenges that pop up and he's a lot more present around the building than a lot of our past managers. Jim, Kassandra, and Steph have been really helpful as well over the past couple years and a friendly face when stopping by the leasing office. Maintenance has been responsive and effective, good enough in fact that I haven't gotten to know their names yet given how infrequently we need their help. As an example we had an appliance break a few weeks ago and there was a brand new appliance in its place by the end of the day. It's beautiful here and the management team is great, but keep in mind the building itself isn't perfect. Most notably foundation settling challenges, water leaks, fire alarms, and a pool that seems to scheme all winter of new issues to delay its opening in the summer. The team is working though to make things better and overall the Greystar team has been a significant improvement over some of our past management teams both in person and the effect they're having on taking on some of the bigger issues the building has had over the years. Thank you! :-)",

          "text": "I am a new Tenant moving in in the next two weeks. So far, my experience with the leasing office has been WONDERFUL! Hillary has been so helpful and patient with me while getting her all the necessary information to move in. She provided me with any answers to my questions and made this process so smooth. She gave a great tour with lots of info about the unit and neighborhood. I am very much looking forward to calling AMLI at Interlocken, home. :) Thanks again Hilary!\n\nUPDATE 8/9/24 AMLI sold the building to Greystar and everything has drastically gone down hill. Something is always broken, fire alarm has gone off 4 dozen times in the 4 years I\u2019ve lived here. Work orders take over two months to be completed. Communication with the leasing office and residences are a joke. I\u2019ve called and email the office to speak to a manager a handful of times and nobody has emailed me or called me back. Genuinely used to love living here, place has really sucked lately.\n\nUPDATE 9/24/24 - building is continuing to go down hill. Pool was opened late 3 years in a show (lucky if we got the pool for two months of summer) now greystar is charging $30 a month TO PARK WHERE WE LIVE, with AMLI first car was free. We didn\u2019t have 24/7 access to the package room for about 8+ months and was only able to get packages during business hours. Front office doesn\u2019t update us on changes. Expect new random charges on your account every month. They are now charging ALL residents for electric and gas in the \u201ccommon areas\u201d which is complete BS. Place is terrible. As other people stated, the fire alarm goes off ALL the time for the most random things. We all have covered the speakers in our units with tape and dish towels to muffle the sound. The other new thing was they replaced my hot water heater - great. I get home and all my lights are on (did it while I was at work) whatever no big deal but then I\u2019m sitting half nude in my own home and hear a knock at the door and then not even a few seconds later, keys entering the lock. I run over to the door and open it to find a man I have never seen in my life. They gave a key to my unit to a VENDOR. Not employed by heights at interlocken and there was no heights maintenance person with them. So two strange men were at my door. As a single women living alone - this is NOT okay.\n\n2/24/25 - it hasn\u2019t gotten any better. Just do yourself a favor and don\u2019t move here. The fire alarm goes off every other week - so much so that a large majority of the tenants have tapped dishrags over the speakers to muffle the debilitating sound, management sends emails threatening tenants rather than encouraging us. There\u2019s dog poop everywhere. They have NEVER stuck to a deadline ever, garage doors are always breaking (you pay $30-$50 to park in there), some of the entry doors to the building you can just pull right open! Mind you, this is supposed to be a secure community. I\u2019ve been here since 2020, I truly used to love living here. Now I can\u2019t wait to move.",

We\u2019d like to offer clarification on the circumstances behind each incident:\n\nThe most recent alarm activation was due to an actual minor fire caused by a tenant. The alarm system responded appropriately, as designed, to ensure safety.\n\nThe two earlier alarm activations occurred due to frozen pipes that burst during freezing temperatures and inclement weather, which led to reduced water pressure in the sprinkler lines.\n\nPlease be assured that we are diligently working to address these issues and improve the overall reliability of our systems. Your feedback is valuable, and we are here to discuss any further concerns you may have.\n\nThank you for your understanding, and we appreciate your patience.\n\nHeights at Interlocken",

She does not seem friendly she snoops around your patio and stares. We have had multiple pass by\u2019s with no hello nothing. Her off leash dog has tried to jump into my first floor balcony at my dog and she didn\u2019t have anything to say and allowed her dog to do that as she saw me trying to get my dog inside.

All patios in this section of the community are situated on a raised retaining wall, which prevents any pets from being able to access or jump onto another patio.\n\nAs part of our regular community walks, we continuously monitor the cleanliness and upkeep of all patios and yards to ensure our shared spaces reflect the high standards we strive for.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to discuss this matter further, please feel free to stop by the office and introduce yourself \u2014 we\u2019d be happy to speak with you in person.

          "text": "RUN FAST. RUN FAR! I have never been treated so shabbily unprofessionally by a leasing complex or company. Documentation was disregarded. Strong-armed into paying additional fines under threat of credit reporting.\n\nI would leave 0 stars if I could. When I was living at Elan Keller Ranch I had some problems. When I moved in in July of '22 as scheduled, the apartment was not properly cleaned. There were cobwebs, the carpet had stains. I documented this in the move-in inspection form. The door handled to the patio door was not properly affixed, the liner on the door was coming off. There was standing water in the apartment from hosing the stairway.  I left this in review and put work orders in. I had to put multiple work orders in to get these issues addressed - and the cobwebs, and the carpet was never addressed. I even left a documented review. Nothing. I decided to move on.\n\nThe next year a very loud family moved in above me rough housing, and loud noises, running children in the middle of the night. I made multiple complaints but this continued. I was told to contact the after hours police liaison, who told me to call 911 if I suspected someone was in danger. No one was to my knowledge (just loud roughhousing, children playing running, jumping at all hours of the night) and so my hands were tied. I continued to make complaints with no resolution.\n\nI moved out in July of '24. I payed about 30% of a month's leasing charges to cover the week that I would be staying. I asked for a summary of charges in advance for the 7 days but they would not furnish me the charges. Not willing to pay a whole month's worth of the lease but not wanting the bank transfer to be marked as late, I estimated the charges at about 30% of the total monthly lease charges (this is the first 7 days out of the month that I was living there before moving out, mind you). I had everything moved out and professionally move-out cleaned by Spruce, the recommended and even sponsored cleaning company of Elan Keller Ranch. Everything was pristine, even the cobwebs were gone. Carpet was the same from move in, but cleaner. No mention of move-out inspection.\n\nWhen I asked for my deposit back a month later I was told there were charges. The condition sink was devalued and the carpet needed to be replaced because of my use. I showed them the review after moving in - nothing. When I tried to get into touch to ask more questions, and for photos of of the sink, no reply. I called and e-mailed multiple times, nothing. Then I heard from the collection agency. I pointed towards my comments on the move-in inspection - they ignored that. There was nothing I could do because I hadn't set a move-out inspection appointment. I cited \"normal wear and tear\" clause as it appeared in my lease, as I knew it had had one. They told me they couldn't speak to that but then cited me the part of my lease that told me I needed to make a move-out inspection appoint if I didn't want to be charged after move out. Because the lease was in their online portal and I was no longer a tenant, they would not provide me a copy of my lease to reference this personally. They said I had the option to dispute, but then said in all honesty it would likely not be successful because of the lack of inspection. I had the documentation and they ignored it. I felt strong-armed into paying because I don't have the fees required for an attorney. They also said that this lack of payment had not be reported to the credit agencies YET, implying that if I did not pay they would. When I asked about if the dispute process would somehow be reflected in my credit score, they told me they couldn't answer that as that would be considered legal advice. Awful experience.",

          "text": "I have lived at Elan Keller for 2 years, and decided not to renew my lease. When I first moved in everyone was so friendly, and welcoming. Some neighbors I\u2019ve met I\u2019m still friends with til this day. A lot of good perks for the area.\n\nIn my first year here, it seemed they could never keep a leasing agent. Each time I went into the office it was always someone new. They would never answer the phone, and were rude when they did. The property and the amenities were rarely maintained. Buildings on the inside were dirty from bugs, birds, weather, and people\u2019s trash spillage on the concert. No one would pick up after their dogs, pool furniture continuously broken. The courtesy officer never coming to assist with complaints. If he did respond it would be hours later, or tell you to call the police. It was all very frustrating to live here.\n\nTowards the middle to end of my second year of living here. I believe they brought in Andrea Gallegos. Things then started to change. The property was getting regularly maintained. The grass being cut, building cleanings, pool being cleaned more, consistent valet trash pick ups, etc. Once she arrived I truly stopped complaining to myself and friends that this place was a mess. She might not have been the only person to turn this place around, but for me it seemed like she the main factor. When I would go to the office I would get 2 different answers on a question. Which was frustrating as well. I went to ask her my same questions, and she was very polite along with informative. Ms. Gallegos definitely knows her stuff and cares about her residents. Now my only continuous issue is parking, but a few steps never hurt anyone.\n\nOverall, the property and its management team I feel have come along way. I would recommend to live here.\n\nPros: close grocery store options, restaurants/bars, walking trails, coffee shops, etc.\n\nCons: Thin walls, loud neighbors, pet droppings on property, no parking, and right gate continuously broken.",

The apartment did not send out an email to residents letting them know this happened. I fear it wasn\u2019t the first. We also had problems with bugs. There is a lot of standing water everywhere so bugs are pretty prevalent outside. Towards the end we struggled with roaches in our apartment. It was really disturbing waking up to them even when we plugged drain holes.",

The regularly planned resident events are fun, and it's nice to see the staff out and about around the property.  A detail that I am most satisfied with is the overall appearance of the building.  It's nice to come home or invite others over and arrive to a clean and orderly property.  It's what sets this building apart from others in the area.  The staff has been wonderful - from Jeffrey to Sharon to Paul to Merideth to Tim and to Angel - and even our wonderful housekeeping team.

The accessibility has been really great and the main doors have access buttons which has been really helpful. The pool also has a lowering chair which is really massive for me as I can safely get in and out of the pool.

My girlfriend and I have been trying to get in contact with someone from the leasing office for over two weeks. We have submitted online tickets to their \"main\" location. We have talked to the live chat agent on the website. We have called office well over 10 different times trying to get information. We have called Zillow and apartments.com to get information but they can also not get a hold of anyone. We have submitted an application for an apartment but have not gotten any response back. They are more than happy to try to charge you over $340 to submit an application but once you do you don't get any sorry of response. This is absolutely ridiculous. Please have one the managers or owners reach out immediately.\n\nDespite my better judgement we decided to move in. Please listen to the attached video and see for yourself if you would want to live here. I am writing this review at 12:50am on our first night here. Already regret moving in.",

          "text": "I moved in to Slate June of 2021. Staff was very efficient and friendly with my move-in process. My unit was clean and looked identical to photos online and the unit I virtually toured.\n\nThe area (fletcher place) is extremely nice. There's a selection of 5-10 restaurants within 3 minutes walking distance, and you will frequently see people running on the sidewalks. Slate is built above an arcade bar and restaurant but very rarely will you experience noise disturbances. In fact, this complex is probably one of the quietest places I've lived. Majority of residents seem to be young professionals.\n\nMaintenance is very fast, responsive, and always provides notice to enter your unit. There was one instance where one of my lightbulbs went out and maintenance replaced the bulb during a furnace check. I was surprised because maintenance staff took care of the issue without my prompting.\n\nRegarding downsides, this unit is expensive, but I personally believe it's worth the price. It can be a bit tricky getting out of the underground parking garage because it's difficult to see cross traffic. The gym is also very small and has minimal equipment. It's a bit far away (10-15 min drive depending on traffic) from IUPUI and the hospitals if you are a student/resident.

Todd was always easy to contact and super helpful, maintenance was great, and I had an absolutely gorgeous view of Lucas Oil. I felt very safe the whole time, and it was overall a very QUIET place to live, which is a big deal for me since I am on call for work.\nYou really can't beat the neighborhood, either -- milktooth across the street, Bluebeard a few blocks up, and Fountain Square right across the bridge. The area is warm and fun, and it's really nice to be able to wake up on a day off and just grab a coffee at Calvin Fletcher and a croissant at Amelia's Bakery, then stroll around exploring!\nIf I were to ever move back to Indianapolis, I would move back into Slate in a heartbeat!",

When the delivery company failed to provide, Todd (the owner) and his staff from Slate stepped in to help make this transition smooth. They allowed us to stay free of charge in another fully furnished unit until our belongings arrived the following Monday.\n\nThis is an immediate example of the benefits of working with a locally owned and operated business rather than dealing with the personally, geographically, and altruistically amputated staff of a distant corporate entity, as we dealt with at our previous luxury apartment in Houston. Todd and his staff are easily accessible and are free to do the 'right' thing due to the lack of constraints from an impersonal property management entity.\n\nFurther, the area is great. Fountain Square has a wide variety of locally owned restaurants, is very walkable with low traffic, and is a very short distance from other nearby pockets of culture and fun. The apartment building has a relatively small number of tenants most of whom are young professionals, and is palpably quiet in the evenings which is conducive to a good night's rest. As new comers to the area, and the state, so far we are happy we chose Slate.",

          "text": "Update: 11/27/2025\nMaking yet another update to my review on my continued great experiences as a tenant at the stonewood apartments homes here in Temecula.\nI'm probably repeating myself at this point but I really can't get over on how much of a change that has been at these apartments since I moved in about 8 to 9 years ago. It was pretty rough in the beginning but this new team is just amazing. All the ladies on the office team are there to greet you with a warm smile and an open ear. They actually listen, how many folks can say in 2025 your apartment complex is looking out for you?\nAnd that office team is backed by an equally as awesome and amazing maintenance team Wayne, Ernesto & every single one of the gentlemen that work on the maintenance team are great and awesome in their own right. I have been lucky enough to have every single one of the gentlemen working my apartment at one time or another for general routine maintenance.\nAs much as you all say thank you to us I wanted to say thank you to all of you for making my continued experience here awesome I look forward to MANY more happy years here with y'all.\nThank you to the entire stonewood apartment homes team and staff for your continued kinship and warm rapport  with my family and I.\n\n________________________________________\nAugust 9th 2023:\nWell just want to make a quick update to my review. I'm going on now almost 7 years and I'm still loving the Stonewood apartments. Though the staff changes the folks who do come are always fabulous and the current team is even better than that. Big shout out to all the ladies in the leasing office.\nAlso want to make a quick shout out to the new maintenance staff member his name is Josh, this gentleman did an outstanding job in my apartment and I wanted to give him a public shout out for that. Anyone planning on moving to the stone woods I've been here now 7 years and counting and I don't have any complaints or plans on moving.\n\nThanks again to ALL the staff, y'all are all awesome.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJust want to take time and say that I really appreciate the staff here at the stonewood apts. Irma and all the staff are just great. Ready to listen when we have a concern or issue and always promptly responding to any issues and concerns.\nI have been here for many years now and hope to continue to have many more.\nThank you and have a blessed day\n\nUpdate!! So I'm going on a little over 5 years and still loving living here, the office staff are still so pleasant to talk to and the maintenance staff is equally just as nice and pleasant to have come and fix things in your apartment. Anyone interested in living in the Temecula area should come check it out most definitely!",

I was left alone and now (after over 2.5 years of living here), I get a note stating I\u2019m not allowed to have a plant at my door???? Threatening he will be disposing of it if I don\u2019t move it by tomorrow? Note was left today, this has NEVER been brought to my attention nor was it ever said that it wasn\u2019t allowed when I moved in. I feel attacked and uncomfortable, my door and entryway is on the 2nd floor, there\u2019s big distance between me and my front door neighbor (who has never had anything negative say about my decor). Stay away from this place, very unprofessional and not sure what type of issues these people have, prior management was much better, good reviews are probably fake. You tell me how the plant in the picture is obstructing anything or anyone! Horrible people!",

The place I live before had a 5 star review that\u2019s because the manager did a good job while living there. She even return all of our deposit. On the other hand, this location charge me the double all because they were remodeling the inside of the apartments to raise the rent for the new residents coming in. BEWARE  for those who live there for more than 10 years they\u2019ll charge you double. Landlords don\u2019t care about their residents remember that. You have the right to see your apartment before signing a paper for this location. Do research. My advice take photos before you moving in to show them how the place look before. Also make sure to record their conversation because they don\u2019t keep their word. They said they weren\u2019t going to charge me for something and then charge me for the same exact thing. When I told the girl about it she said \u201c I never said that.\u201d Just be careful with this place. They\u2019re nice to you now because you\u2019re resident, but the minute you move out they\u2019ll treat you differently. BEEARE!",

It looks and smells terrible, it's attracting flies like crazy, you can't even sit outside on your patio without attacked by flies. People are letting their dogs defecate on the grass and not picking it up. We are always told to take pictures of this happening, but we will be retaliated against because they will see us taking the pictures. The main entrance\nAlways looks nice, but the rest of the grounds always looks bad.\nPeople don't obey the speed limit, and drive much faster than the posted speed limit.\nI know nothing will be done about these problems will not be taken care of, but I just thought I would voice my opinion.\n\nThe office staff has gotten better, but I do have a complaint about the landscaping. Is there any reason that when they reseeded they used seeds for CRAB GRASS INSTEAD OF BERMUDA SEEDS. My first husband and I owned a landscaping business, that is why I know the difference in seeding.  You can certainly tell the difference in grass, and it truly looks like hell, some places have Bermuda but mostly Crab Grass was used.\nBesides saving money, is there any other reason?",

I was on the ground floor and the neighbor upstairs sounded like an elephant walking across his apartment. There are quite a few tenants who are irresponsible pet owners and don\u2019t control their dogs; mine was attacked twice. They don\u2019t pick up after their dogs either, there is always poop everywhere. MEB promptly raised rent prices when they bought the complex and the prices were already pretty high for how tiny the apartments were. My neighbor backed into my car and scraped paint off it in the parking lot; don\u2019t expect management to do anything or care about it. I left due to buying a house and my mortgage payment is less than what I used to pay for rent\u2026and now I have way more space. The former manager was nice but never really dealt with problems I brought to his attention. New manager was very nice but I moved out about a month after she started so I don\u2019t know how effective she was. Overall these apartments are nice, but I hope they fixed the non functioning security cameras in the laundry room. Someone stole my earbuds in there and when I asked to see the security footage I was told by the manager that the cameras didn\u2019t work!\n\nFollow up:\n\nI have now been moved out for almost four years and did not receive any money back. Not sure if I was supposed to, but I thought at least some of my deposit was refundable. Not surprised though, as this is the second time I have lived in an MEB owned apartment complex and there are always issues. They\u2019re pretty crappy landlords and I\u2019d avoid renting from them if you can.",

          "text": "GREAT PLACE - I'm not getting any perks for writing this review, I just want people who are considering renting here to see it.\nI have lived here for ten years. During that time there have been a few changes of ownership, and several managers - some good, some not so good.\nAs of now - December, 2023 - the ownership/management is top notch. I recently put in a maintenance request, and within two days (it wasn't an emergency) the guy came and totally fixed the problem. The manager is friendly and helpful, and it's quiet and peaceful around here (no homeless in the area). It is on the eastern edge of Tucson, with a lot of open spaces and a great Mountain View.\nThe grounds are beautiful and well maintained. The design of the apartments is wonderful (especially the upper level, with vaulted ceilings and a skylight). All have balconies.\nIf you're thinking about renting here, do it. You won't be sorry.",

          "text": "Living at The Hunter has been one of those rare experiences where every detail, from the moment you walk into the building to the way the light hits your apartment in the late afternoon, feels intentionally designed to elevate daily life. Even in early December, with the crisp Colorado air outside, our 7th-floor apartment radiates warmth, calm, and effortless elegance.\n\nThe extra-tall ceilings immediately transform the space. Light stretches upward and bounces off the quartz countertops, stainless steel appliances, the beautiful kitchen backsplash, and the wood-look flooring. Every corner feels open, airy, and thoughtfully designed. The stackable in-unit washer and dryer, garages, and additional storage options make everyday life smooth, convenient, and unexpectedly luxurious.\n\nThe layout options are vast, accommodating a variety of lifestyles, and the balcony is genuinely a private retreat. City views in one direction, mountains in the other \u2014 morning coffee, evening sunsets, or just pausing for a quiet moment feel elevated every single time. The apartment feels luxurious without being ostentatious, yet somehow still manages to feel like home.\n\nThe amenities go far beyond what one expects from an apartment community. Fitness and movement studios with embroidered towels that somehow make you feel fancy, coworking and conference/Zoom rooms that feel modern and professional, a heated pool and hot tub that are essentially resort-level, and yes, a golf simulator \u2014 every detail has been thoughtfully executed. Pet-friendliness is extreme, smart building technology is seamless, and the little touches really set The Hunter apart: custom-named Hunter mugs at the coffee station, embroidered towels in the fitness areas, welcome-home bags, branded pens, and the intercom system that lets guests in without a hitch \u2014 all adding layers of polish and thoughtfulness that make everyday living feel elevated.\n\nThe staff at The Hunter make the experience even better. Stephanie guided us flawlessly through our lease and moving process, and while Kyla wasn\u2019t our direct agent, her helpfulness is felt throughout the building. Vanessa, the property director, manages the community with professionalism and warmth, and Chris in maintenance is consistently prompt, friendly, and effective. Together, they make the building feel genuinely cared for, not just managed.\n\nThe location is ideal: central to downtown Colorado Springs, restaurants, shops, and entertainment, yet tucked back enough to be peaceful and private. You get all the energy of downtown without the hustle and chaos. I had a hard time finding anything wrong \u2014 every detail has been thoughtfully executed, every convenience accounted for.\n\nThe Hunter even makes the little things feel like a treat. The payment portal is seamless and stress-free, the user-friendly apps make scheduling, rent, and community access effortless, and the intercom adds a level of convenience that makes welcoming guests feel effortless. Honestly, this is the kind of apartment that makes your friends jealous the moment they step in: from the light-filled interiors to the balcony views, the luxe finishes, the thoughtfully curated amenities, and the smart tech everywhere, it\u2019s a living experience that elevates daily life without trying too hard.\n\nIf you want to live somewhere that makes you feel like you leveled up in life just by walking through the door\u2026 The Hunter is it.",

          "text": "Update: We have since moved out, but the Quinci was by far the worst \"luxury living\" community I've ever been in. Homeless, package theft, illegal parking at all times of day, off leash animals, fake reviews from employees of Kairoi, and a horrible location. Right now it seems the rent is effectively ~1700 a month, which is what I'd say it's worth. Rather than the 2450 they gave us for our lease renewal.\n\nWhere to even begin...To preface this review, Mikayla, Angel, and Josue are all great to work with. Moving in was easy. My partner and I have been at The Quinci for 4 months now and it has been by far the worst renting experience of our lives.\n\nUpon move in, we were given information from previous property director Brittani about the timelines and capabilities of the amenities. These timelines were completely unfounded, as nothing besides the pickleball courts are currently available and we are a good portion through our lease already. Had we of known this, we would have chosen to live elsewhere.\u00a0We are currently living in a CONSTANT construction zone, which shakes the buildings nearly everyday from 7am-4pm.\n\nWithin the past 4 months we have encountered the following issues (from least to most recent):\n1. Some extremely inconsiderate tenants that trash the property with their cigarette butts and garbage\n2. Off leash dogs roaming the property, sometimes with no owners in sight whatsoever\n3. German cockroaches, which, hopefully, is now completely remedied.\n4. Mailboxes weren't available to use for over 2 months of our lease. requiring us to drive to the airport post office to collect our mail, or wait for Mikayla to graciously collect it for us once a week.\n5. Ant infestation. Now remedied.\n6. Water heater wasn't turned on upon moving in, leaving us without hot water.\n7. Bedroom door couldn't latch when closing\n8. Charging station for electric vehicles still in development with no timelines or estimates in sight\n9. Pickleball court lights only recently installed, over 3 months into our lease term\n10. The grills are still not functional even though they're \"Installed\"\n11. Rent has now decreased on this property over $200 a month and $300 a month for the 3 bedrooms.\n\nLastly, and the MOST important issue of all (as of late) is the complete repaving and re-construction of all of the driveways and entrances to our garages throughout the property due to it not being up to code for drainage. This is likely to leave us without access to our garages for well over a month, initially starting in early/mid October and supposedly ending mid November (originally expected end of October) with no consolation to the tenants from upper management. This has caused us to need to haul our groceries, gear, equipment, etc. 600 feet through construction each day. it's an enormous inconvenience to us as tenants, that the property owners couldn't care less about.\n\nMikayla has been a great help in hearing our complaints and helping us through so many of the issues we've had here. Unfortunately, enough is enough, and The Quinci is deserving of nothing more than the rating given. I highly encourage anyone reading this review and considering The Quinci to reconsider and move somewhere else more stable.",

The maintenance team is also incredibly responsive and efficient, always quick to handle any repairs or issues that come up.\n\nThe only drawbacks I\u2019ve experienced are due to a few residents: some people walk their dogs off-leash, which can be frustrating, and there are occasional problems with people parking in front of our garage, sometimes blocking us in or out for hours or even overnight. Fortunately, the staff does their best to handle these issues as quickly and effectively as possible.\n\nOverall, my experience at The Quinci has been very positive, and the attentive and friendly team truly makes a difference.",

Our move-in process came with a few hiccups, however, Mikayla made it right every time.\n\nWe were made aware of the road closures due to asphalt repair a few days before our move-in. We were accommodated by being moved to a unit that could be accessed. In our lease, there was a form stating that construction may cause impacts to the property. Because of this, we had a clear understanding when the road closures occurred. Thankfully, we have not had any issues while parking in the parking lot behind the property. Mikayla has also provided us with reasonable compensation for the inconvenience.\n\nOur garage and shower door have an ongoing maintenance issue that has yet to be resolved, however, the maintenance team was quick to come and identify the issue. Aside from that, our townhome seems to be nicely built and functional.\n\nOverall, we have enjoyed our new home so far. Our neighbors have been welcoming and kind. We look forward to enjoying the amenities once they are ready!",

On the fourth month of living here they decided to entirely rip up and repave the areas in front of the garages\n- loud machinery, quaking apartment, litter and butts strewn about. Random beams and poles scattered, large equipment and no parking available on the property. Dirty and dusty\n- park in a parking lot of an empty building where homeless hang out and there are no security cameras. Walk 600+ feet to your car\n- no walkable destinations nearby and located in a trucking industrial part of town (priced the same as a sugarhouse or downtown apt with a pool and more amenities)\n- lowered the price $200 for the same unit as a new resident because they are having trouble filling it up - yet I am expected to pay the higher rate for enduring this massive headache and quite honestly the worst apartment experience I\u2019ve had in 27 years.\n\nDon\u2019t move here!!!!!!!!!!!",

Moving from Italy for work, I was asked for an exorbitantly high security deposit (still unrefunded) and countless other incidentals to find an apartment that was, to say the least, unsightly, dirty, full of black dust, and smelly. In three months, I called maintenance numerous times because the appliances (washing machine, A/C, dishwasher, etc.) weren't working or were leaking, but each time I was told nothing was broken and they promptly returned a second time to replace the appliances. The owner and maintenance staff entered the apartment numerous times without me being there, and on a couple of occasions I found the bathroom flooded and the floor filthy and dirty. The only time management contacted me (I've never had the pleasure of meeting anyone from management) was via email to demand I pay $3,500 to avoid a bad rental record. I'm leaving the apartment at the end of November and am counting down the days until this nightmare is over. I strongly advise against staying here.",

Staff is always kind and ready to help. The gym is nice and big as well as the pool area. What I use on the daily is the Starbucks coffee machine! I have to make a run to the leasing office about every morning to get me a cup or two! I love that I can do that saves me so much!

The rooms are immaculate but the Rules are just too much for employed people. The limitation on the number of people and the time limit on visitors is their only downfall.. The fact that LUNA accommodates grown adults that are working it should give you the freedom to sign your visitors if and when you want too. Even if we have to pay for a visitor that needs to check out at 10am that I signed in at 3am its ok\u2026 honestly thats their only downfall\u2026 the visitors part, the limitation on daily visitors should go back to 2 and the time should be unlimited, like it was when they first introduced the app. R110 is nothing just to accommodate family/or whoever that arrives at Luna.

(check their insta @liveatpark17 and you will see what i\u2019m talking about\u2026) and there\u2019s livable spaces for all kinds of needs and sizes. added- it\u2019s one of the more well maintained dog friendly apartments in the area, too. the trash is handled and the garages stay clean for being in the city. they also will make extra efforts to help build and keep the community strong, inside and outside of the property. I have met so many wonderful neighbors even showing up late to said events!\n\nif you start to feel cooped up, you have a whirlwind of businesses and activities of all kind to check out right next door or across the street, branching out more into the neighborhoods also is worth it. :)\nit\u2019s walking distance from the hospital and many medical services, 1mile downhill walk to downtown for us folks still in office, transit is nearby, too, and very easy to use! the farmer\u2019s market is a hit this time of year and is also walking/biking distance (protected bike lanes on 16th a block over!). parks around park too! :)\n\nthe neighborhood is alive and i\u2019d love for you to become my new neighbor.\n\nI hope this review helps you check off the boxes you need for your searching.\nit\u2019s definitely always worth reaching out to the crew to see how they can meet your needs (EVEN AS A CURRENT RESIDENT! this leasing office and maintenance want to keep your experience comfortable! talk to them!).\n\nPS i\u2019m sorry staff for taking so long to write this out, but you know I love y\u2019all :) -Audri",

          "text": "I moved into Ridian apartments 6 months ago. I intentionally waited until I\u2019ve lived here for a while to leave a review because I rely on these type of reviews when making an important decision like\nsigning a year and a half long lease and I\u2019m sure other people do too. That being said, after living here since June, I can confidently give Ridian 5 stars and recommend it 100% for anyone looking to move to LoHi.\n\nTo begin, the building is brand new and very high-end. You get top-of-the-line appliances and finishes. For a smaller community, you also still get very nice amenities- the gym is fantastic, the pool and hot tub areas are great, and the rooftop grill and fire pit are sweet. (Especially the downtown view!) Just as important is the staff. Hanna is the best in the game, hands down. She leads with intention and care and makes sure that residents truly feel at home. I\u2019ve been impressed since day 1. I\u2019ve not had any issues that require maintenance, but I\u2019ve heard neighbors speak highly of Wes and his response times. So that\u2019s very assuring to me.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s talk about the neighborhood. 33rd and Eliot is IDEAL. It\u2019s quiet here and you\u2019re half a mile in each direction from all things LoHi and all things Highlands Square. You\u2019re also very close to Tennyson. People are always on walks and runs and bike rides. I often bike to work downtown and it takes me 8 mins, which is awesome.\n\nVery glad I moved into Ridian and hope to call it home for a while! Again, I think lots of people rely on these reviews to make important decisions and I\u2019ve proud to be able to give this community honest, praise-worthy feedback.",

There is also a nice neighborhood nearby with an outside gym thats great for getting outdoors. 15min from the city and a great price. I found it convenient living close to a Target, HomeGoods, HEB, BlackRock Coffee and MovieHouse Eatery. Big thank you to Scott and Andres in the leasing department for being extremely responsive via email/phone and helpful in sourcing necessary documents. Would absolutely recommend!",

The community is always quiet and clean, making me feel safe. The amenities are incredibly well kept. The staff is friendly, responsive, and genuinely welcoming. I also love the community events. They create such a great sense of connection with neighbors. Overall, a wonderful place to live! As this chapter of my life closes, I'll forever cherish my time spent at Pearl Lantana!",

We once had an issue with our water heater, and the staff went above and beyond to make sure it was resolved. That\u2019s just one example of the many positive experiences we\u2019ve had here.\n\nOur family is sad to leave, but very grateful for the time we spent here.

The atmosphere is relaxed, the grounds are beautiful, and the staff is consistently excellent and genuinely friendly. Some of my most peaceful moments here have been simply enjoying the nighttime vibes around the property.\n\nWhat really stands out is how personal every interaction feels. The staff greets you like familiar faces rather than treating you like just another number. They put real effort into building a sense of community, and it shows.\n\nThe resident events are a great touch and make it easy to meet people. We\u2019ve enjoyed everything from poolside movie nights with snacks, to pool parties, to bagels & Bloody Mary\u2019s, to the Halloween martini mixer. These little things add up and make the whole place feel warm and welcoming.\n\nThe office and common areas are always inviting as well. The holiday decorations \u2014 especially at Christmas \u2014 make it feel more like a home than a standard apartment community. You can tell the staff treats this place like their own second home.\n\nThe location is another major perk. It\u2019s an easy walk to Black Rock Coffee, Playa Bowls, and plenty of other retail spots. I\u2019m often out early in the morning and always see people walking, running, or out with their dogs along Rialto Blvd. If you cross into the nearby residential area, you\u2019ll find quiet neighborhoods with routes that let you get 3 to 6 miles in with minimal traffic.\n\nCommuting is also convenient, with quick access to Loop 1, 360, 71, and 290 \u2014 all within about five minutes.\n\nPearl Lantana truly feels like a community where people enjoy living. Thank you for a great experience. The only reason we\u2019re leaving is due to a work relocation \u2014 otherwise we would stay much longer.",

          "text": "An Honest and Grateful Review of The Pearl Lantana\n\nAfter moving city to city and experiencing my fair share of disappointing apartment complexes, The Pearl Lantana truly felt like a home away from home. I lived here for about two years, and from day one, I knew this place was different.\n\nThe Property:\nThe community is always clean, peaceful, and well-maintained\u2014this isn\u2019t a place where things get patched up with temporary fixes. Every improvement, every upgrade, feels intentional and genuinely made with the residents in mind. It's not just a place where things work\u2014it\u2019s a place that\u2019s beautiful to come home to.\n\nAmenities:\nThe gym has everything you need for a full-body workout, and the pool areas (especially the central \u201cfamily pool\u201d) are perfect for grilling, relaxing, or just soaking in a good day. I never had recurring issues with anything on-site\u2014if something ever needed attention, it was addressed immediately. Even the one time the grill gave us trouble, it was up and running again the next day.\n\nMaintenance:\nHands down one of the most reliable and respectful maintenance teams I\u2019ve ever encountered. They often completed service requests the same day, and if not, it was handled the next. Never once did I feel ignored or brushed off\u2014they take pride in their work and treat every apartment like it\u2019s their own.\n\nThe Units:\nModern, clean, and thoughtfully designed. I especially loved the spacious kitchens and the overall luxury feel. It really is a pleasure walking through your door and feeling proud of your space.\n\nSafety:\nNo theft, no unwanted visitors, and no signs of homelessness on property. That sense of security meant a lot to me and made it feel safe for anyone\u2014whether you\u2019re living alone, with a partner, or starting a family.\n\nThe Heart of the Property\u2014The Staff:\nThis is what truly sets The Pearl Lantana apart. Andre and Emma (and the rest of the amazing team\u2014whose names I wish I remembered!) don\u2019t just do their jobs\u2014they build community. They remember your name, your apartment, your story. You\u2019re never just a tenant here. They treat you like a neighbor, a friend, and sometimes even like family. I\u2019ve never had a property staff go so far above and beyond, and for that, I\u2019ll always be grateful.\n\nOnly One Suggestion:\nIf I had to name one critique\u2014it\u2019s the speed demons driving through the property. A few more speed bumps wouldn\u2019t hurt.\n\nTo Andre, Emma, and the entire team: thank you for everything. You\u2019ve built something special here, and it shows. I\u2019ll always look back on my time at The Pearl Lantana with appreciation and fondness.\n\n\u2014Ronald",

The gym, pool, and clubhouse were consistently clean and serene \u2014 we hosted many gatherings there and made some truly wonderful memories.\n\nOne memorable experience stands out: one night around 9:30 pm, our climate control system stopped working. We contacted maintenance, and they responded promptly. While they couldn\u2019t fix the issue immediately, they provided us with additional coolers to keep us comfortable through the night.

          "text": "Not terrible, but not great either. The actual unit I have is fine, happy with it, wasn't cleaned properly by the time I arrived but can look past it (just some scruffs and finger marks on appliances). Community is nice and inviting, and its pretty quiet. Seems like working professionals around the same age group. Its a good part of town too. Wish the parking situation for guests (or lackthereof) could be improved but given where it is in town this isn't really management's fault or problem to be fair, and the unit is nice enough to again overlook that.\n\nThe elevator closest to my unit doesn't work, and the one that does work is painfully slow. I just take the stairs now to the 4th floor but sill given the price I'd expect that to be done. Also was a pain for the movers and as a result I probably ended up paying a little more than originally anticipated. Again, can overlook this for the time being assuming the other elevator will be fixed (believe it will be based on communication I've received)\n\nThe leasing office itself leaves a bit to be desired. I'm not sure what the capacity the building(s) is (are) currently at, but it's certainly nowhere near full, so the fact they get overwhelmed with simple things like parking is pretty concerning. Today I was told by the Director via email that I wasn't permitted to park in the garage and wasn't part of my lease (it is actually part of my lease, they later confirmed it), and that I would be towed if I don't add it to my lease by 3:00PM (of course no apology for the threat).\n\nThen the assistant director called me separately at around almost the exact same time saying that I was in the wrong spot and my spot was a spot over (how can this be true if the director claimed I have no spot). I told her that I don't think that's the case but could I move it when I get back from work, to which I was basically told 'no', and that it again could be towed and they wanted to avoid a \"chain reaction\" and get it taken care of as quickly as possible. Well, I drop everything I'm doing at work and walk 20 minutes down to the apartment and get in the garage and surprise surprise my car is in the RIGHT SPOT. I called the Asst. Director back and asked why I just dropped everything and came down for what they were basically pitching as an emergency when in reality  they were making problems where there was literally no issue - they screwed up two times in a row.\n\nThe Asst. Director, Tatum, basically took little accountability and seemed confused and miffed as to why I would be upset with the situation, then gave an insincere 'sorry', as if she didn\u2019t know what she was apologizing for, which was a little strange. Again, important to remember that it wasn't a situation where they said 'please just move it tonight and check when you get back', it was instead pitched as it needed handled now in the middle of a workday.",

However, end of 2023, there started to be issues with their hallways smell awful all the time, then they started to kick people out of the buildings. You can find multiple previous residents' reviews - sadly, they are all true. Unfair and inconsistent treatment by the management company - High alert!\n\nOn the other hand, this management company will charge you crazy amount of fees despite they told you only certain charges. Now I live in AMLI just a few streets down and know the differences are significant:\n- Station's basic water/trash/sewer/gas total is 3 times more than my current apartment!\n- Station charges you MORE fee items than other apartments. Get ready for things that you don't understand and valet trash (they also increased valet trash fees without telling residents!!!!)\n- Station's parking: you pay for a parking spot but you have to also pay for an additional monthly fee.\n\nThere are better options out there...",

While I am part of the team, I am writing a true review of living here, as JUST a resident and NOT as staff**\n\nDespite the ongoing renovations at Station Riverfront community, I couldn't be happier with the location. Being close to the park is essential for me, especially with two dogs. The sense of community among the residents is a wonderful bonus, making it truly feel like home. Since moving in November 2023, I've appreciated the convenience of being able to walk to nearby restaurants, vets, museums, and grocery stores, and drive to all my favorite places like red rocks, mission ballroom, ogden theatre, filmore, and countless bars in the area in a short amount of time! I had a chance to live anywhere, but I wouldn't be as happy as I am living at Station, the convenience tops EVERYTHING!",

There have been both pros and cons which I list below but that\u2019s to be expected with any community. I have enjoyed my experience here so far and really don\u2019t have many complaints but because I am leaving a public review I want to be honest about the things I like and the things that annoy me.\n\nPros:\n\n*Quiet community despite the location - neighbors are very quiet and everyone in my building adheres to the quiet hours policy.\n* Lots of space in the one bedroom floorplan I lease - two closets (one walk-in), large living area and nice sized bedroom and bathroom.\n* Attentive management company - I understand this management company recently took over the property, and they are doing a good job of keeping residents up to date on projects, and host lots of resident events, and are easy to deal with\n* Maintenance is responsive and addresses issues quickly and efficiently\n* Great location - five minute walk to LoHi, ten minute walk to grocery stores, Ball Arena, Elitch Gardens, bars, restaurants, etc.\n* Amenities - package locker, valet trash, hot tub, heated pool, nice clubhouse area, gym, yoga studio, etc.\n\nCons:\n\n*My unit has a two-sided fireplace that doesn\u2019t work, and will not be fixed - I chose this floorplan for the two-sided fireplace so the fact that it is unusable and I was not told this when I inquired about switching to this floorplan is a little annoying but not a deal breaker either\n* Rent seems a little high. Apartments were renovated a few years ago, possibly by the last management company, but in my apartment I can see some cut corners: 1) kitchen sink drain is off center and doesn\u2019t drain properly 2) bathroom sink has rust spots that were present when I moved in 3) fireplace doesn\u2019t work 4) granite countertops are nice but mine has a large, noticeable seam where two pieces were put together 5) bathtub/tile has not been updated in several years and 6) common areas are nice and well maintained but hallways are very dark and sometimes smell a little funny (again, not necessarily a dealbreaker but want to be transparent and honest).\n* Constant construction - package room installation, pool area tiles, fire suppression project, elevators often down etc.\n\nAgain, overall my experience has been really pleasant and I have enjoyed my time here.",

We appreciate you bringing these matters to our attention, and we hope to make things right soon.\n",

As we moved in we had a few maintenance items that needed resolved and the maintenance team was quick to get every issue resolved. The management team in the leasing office is very helpful and they communicate well. The dog park is one of my new favorite spots as its a great area to get to know other residents of the human and canine kind. So far we have been extremely happy with our \"almost\" first month living here and i expect that experience to continue. Thank you AVANT!",

Just last week there was a young lady (African American) in the lobby calling the security and staff derogatory words because they requested her guest sign in with our new security system and she lost her mind. I was baffled by this behavior because 1. Why would the concierge asking your guest to sign in set you off like this? 2.This is a requirement for all residents why would do you feel exempt. I could not believe an Alcott resident would behave in such a manner but after meeting a few of these residents at our residential events the behavior tracks for some. It brings me a peace of mind that Anthony has remained consistent and fair to all residents where I notice other concierges turn a blind eye and show select favoritism toward certain residents",

While most staff members are pleasant, one individual, Anthony, has been consistently rude and unprofessional. I have reached out to both staff and management on multiple occasions, yet these concerns have gone unaddressed.\nThe lack of response raises concerns about unequal treatment and accountability, which has created an uncomfortable environment for myself and other residents. While the building is aesthetically impressive, the lack of consequences and follow-through regarding staff behavior is disappointing. I would not renew my lease and encourage prospective residents to choose wisely.\nMe personally residents should be number 1 priority in a place they will be living while on lease. Sad to say it\u2019s not there priority. Recent incident where staff left because he was asked to turn tv on in the common area he left for the day and now everyday he just ignors me speaks to everyone as they walk in besides me. VERY SAD",
