I tried to give them some grace and the benefit of the doubt but it had been over two months since I was owed my deposit and I have yet to receive it. I have been either given the run around and told I would get a call back (which I didn\u2019t) or I\u2019m asked to email them and they never respond back. I have evidence of the emails where they didn\u2019t respond and call recordings with contradictions Aboit when they sent out the check. I will update this thread when I finally get a response and my refund. Used to be a great place to live, completely different experience. Also, they said I owed them money until I showed them that I paid my rent. I\u2019m sure if I took this long to pay them, it wouldn\u2019t be acceptable.

Staff are rude to tenants and email language to tenants is passive aggressive for things outside of their control. An example recently was from a notice of external facing doors of the property and a message was sent out saying tenants would be liable if found to leave the doors open.  The catch though - the doors are broken. Some don't even have a Spring Hinge/Self Closing Gate Hinge. They also don't work with the key fobs. Highly recommend any tenant to look elsewhere.",

The apartment is centered with lots of shopping and eats nearby so there was nothing short of boredom.

I had a faulty kitchen sink faucet once and the next day, maintenance replaced the entire faucet with a brand new one.

          "text": "I've been living at Parkside at Round Rock for about a year now and I can\u2019t recommend it enough! The customer service here is truly outstanding. From the moment I moved in, the leasing agent, assistant manager, and property manager have gone above and beyond to make sure all my needs are met. They\u2019re incredibly attentive, always ready to help with a smile, which really makes a difference in the overall experience of living here.\n\nThe apartments themselves are spacious and well-designed, offering fantastic value for the price. I love how much room I have to spread out, and the layouts are perfect for both relaxation and entertaining.\n\nOne of my favorite features is the dog park! It\u2019s a wonderful space where my pups can play and socialize with other dogs. Plus, the dog wash stations are a lifesaver\u2014no more messy baths at home after a fun day at the park!\n\nThe fitness center is another highlight, equipped with high-quality machines and plenty of space to work out. It\u2019s always clean and well-maintained, making it easy to stick to my fitness goals.\n\nThe location is also ideal. It\u2019s conveniently situated near shops, restaurants, and parks, making it easy to get out and enjoy everything the area has to offer.\n\nOverall, I love living here at Parkside! It feels like a community, and I\u2019m grateful for the friendly staff and great amenities. If you\u2019re considering a new place to live, definitely check this place out!",

I hope this review has helped keep the potential residents informed on what this apartment does to people during a pandemic.\nEdit: In reply to managements comment. We used to live at a sister property to this complex. We transfered our lease to Parkside for the job opportunities. We were led to believe that we would be having the exact same lease since both properties were owned by the same person and managed by Lincoln. We new that the lease breaking for the other property would be one months rent and a 30 day notice. We were under the impression that they had given us the exact same rules and lease transfer points. We both know we should have read more into the small print and finer points. But, we were too trusting of the company. Even now, there is still miscommunication between the team and leaders. We were told we could leave our keys and they would still allow us to pay the 60 day notice for each month's rent. Then we receive an email stating that if we left them our keys they want the extra $3000 immediately. We aren't asking for our money back. But, we want to keep others from making the same mistake we did and being screwed out of a lot of money during these times.\n\nYou should avoid Parkside at all costs. They take advantage of the pandemic and people losing jobs. My husband and I moved to Parkside for work. But, due to Covid, we are now having to relocate to Ohio. Parkside has demanded more then $7000 from us. Due to circumstances, our jobs are not able to help relocate. We owe more then $7000 after they have taken our deposits.  We are not the only ones, we have neighbors getting ready to take out loans so that they can provide for their family so that they can relocate for work. We tried talking to them to let them know we needed to relocate for jobs. They would not work with us. We asked if we could transfer our lease and were refused. Because of the Pandemic, they have revoked the ability to transfer to sister properties. This place is taking advantage of those being affected by Covid. This is such a bad company and apartment. We asked if we could set up a payment plan, and Ty in Leasing said he would ask corporate and ghosted us. I cannot voice how horrible this complex is. If you move here. Make sure to check every hidden fee as well as do not be in a situation of having to relocate due to jobs, family, and Covid. Also, we were the first ones living in the apartment.  And you can see how cheaply it is put together. We have had pants torn as well as cuts to ourselves and our dogs due to exposed painted over nails. Our cabinets lost their handles, and the drywall looks as if it is falling off the walls.",

As previous tenants stated, the property management changed a few times while living there & after move out it took 9 MONTHS to receive not even half of our security deposit. We left the unit spotless, professionally cleaned. They charge luxury prices but not a luxury experience!! Pitiful. They made it so difficult to get in contact with those in charge of returning deposits. I would call, email, left voicemails to property and the management company with no solution or help for 9months!!!! Ridiculous!! Also beware of the Ant problem it\u2019s true- 2 of our bedrooms and living room became infested with ants! It was terrible. Dog poop everywhere when walking around the property as well. If you have kids beware of the speeding in/near parking garage. They never ever had security gates put up either during that time which lead to theft of our property in Jan 2023. Hopefully some changes have been made- Beware!",

This bike room was first advertised to me as a complex amenity while taking a tour of the place. WHAT A JOKE. I never understood why there was a key card entry for the gym but not the bike room\u2026? There was even a security camera in the entree way of the building the bike room is in\u2014and still nothing was done by management to review footage and help me solve the theft. I had to file a police report and tried asking management to send me video footage from the security camera but I, along with the officer on my case, got nothing but RADIO SILENCE from the complex. They then lied to me about returning the officer\u2019s call. Management failed me in so many ways during my stay that the only thing I can do to feel better is to warn others. Don\u2019t live here! Don't fall for B.S. amenities they sell you. Your money is best spent somewhere else.",

Red ants in between the walls during the summer coming out the outlets. They charge $25 for useless fetch delivery services.

Anyone can drive in and through the complex, despite them advertising as a private parking lot.  This has been the case since Avenue 5 has purchased the property back in June 2021.  They have not been able to get trash cleanup under control.  They have not fixed issues with the mail room and now they keep YOUR packages in their office.  This makes it super inconvenient to get your mail.  The dog park is sad and often taken over by the same groups of people with hostile dogs that force you to leave.  The parking garage is a danger because this property has no speed bumps or mirrors or signage.  People speed all the time through here.  You cannot smoke inside the property yet there are no smoking designated areas outside.  There has been zero improvements made and in fact, many amenities are now worthless or not working here.  Yet they have the nerve to raise rent on everyone?  Do yourself a huge favor and ignore or move out of this complex.",

Lincoln, Assurance, then Greystar. When I moved in, the carpets were installed incorrectly leaving hills (which they are charging me for). There were always issues with the trash valet. And now that I moved out, they are charging me for damages that I did not make. They are also trying to charge me for things that don\u2019t appear damaged (the toilet photo). They even tried charging me for damage to my outside wall which people hit with furniture while moving in/out. I attached images of the items I tried to dispute with Sherron Joseph at Greystar but she would ignore my emails. Now they sent me to debt collections while still not responding to my questions. Shameful.\n\nUpdate: I paid the remaining note from when I was sent to collections. They were non negotiable and would not respond to my emails prior to the deadline. I decided to pay because I am just a person and they are a huge corp that would drown me in legal bills when they sue me.

The staff before and the staff currently 2022 have always been super friendly, caring and want the very best for the residents. There is no perfect property but coming from many other apt communities with a lot more issues I am glad to call Parkside home.\n\nStaff works very hard to keep up with everything and you are centrally located to any and everything you could want. Shopping, restaurants, gyms, movie theater, grocery stores and right off IH 35 or quick shot over to Toll 130. Really it is all within walking distance if you choose.  Two big dog parks for your fur kiddos and a super nice dog washing station.\n\nThe property is well thought out and the amenities are awesome. You won't need a gym membership or find a nicer pool area to enjoy right out side your front door. The apartments are spacious and offer many floor plans for your liking. Give it a TRY and you will find you are happy to call Parkside home as well.",

Our apartment also towed my car without warning and did not let me know leading me to panicking at 7:00 in the morning with no way to get to college and calling the police to try and figure out hat happened to my car. Furthermore parking that used to be free now cost money if you want to park by the doors. I recently was contacted by management after posting this review to a company survey and they ensured me they would look into it and get back to me the next day about making it up to me.

About eight months after Avenue 5 took over, it was not the smoothest transition, and unfortunately, they let the community go down. It is not what it once was but have they ever done anything that directly affected my living? The answer is no things they could work on would be making sure staff can answer questions and are available to answer the phone. This was very frustrating. Also, the turnover was horrible maintenance seems like they could use a little better guidance as work orders were being closed out but not done. Also, instead of nitpicking about yards and what people put on them, how about fixing the more prominent issues the complex has had since Avenue 5 took over? Would I recommend living here? I would, but you will need a lot of patience and need to ignore the problems that this company still hasn't figured out yet. I would give this a solid 3/5, and that's just me being lucky enough never to have problems with my specific unit hope they get it together apartment still has a lot of potentials.",

When logging into my leasing portal it clearly stated that my vehicle was there and was a vehicle for my unit. They said that it was not under my vip parking and they don\u2019t release the keys unless there is a vehicle signed up under that softwar. However, my keys were given to me without verification on that so this all fall backs on their lack of communication. Also, back track two months when I got the keys my unit was FILTHY with stains all over the fridge, dog hair in the unit, unmapped floors that after stepping on the floor with white socks turned my socks BLACK! I asked them to send someone to clean it the following day before I moved my furniture in when the furniture company got there on their time being paid from my own wallet the unit was not cleaned and was still in the same disgusting condition it was given to me in. As a new resident I am extremely disappointed in the customer service aspect of how things have been handled since the jump. Not to mention, they have an officer on the property who feels the need to harass residents like he\u2019s apart of the office staff and as a woman living in her unit alone that is quite intimidating and does not make me feel comfortable here at all. He asked me my unit number on multiple occasions which does not make me feel at home one bit. This has been a whole situation. Working two jobs and being in Nursing school I barely have free time to myself and to be late to class because my vehicle was towed without actually being contacted to see if there was some type of mistake or what is super disappointing.

There are neighbors who are chronic complainers about the smallest of things no matter what time of the day or night or week or weekend it may be and nothing is done about someone who is basically an apartment bully. With that said, the management team I have no fault with however, I do have very large issues with the fact that I can hear everything because the walls are so thin. The price is not worth it if I have to hear my neighbor's  loo flush and the conversations. Good place to live but I wouldn't recommend it either.",

          "text": "Update: 4/2023\nWhere to begin....this place is a mess, from the management/staff to the billing. We just moved out and were charged $10 (for a trashbag and other fraudulent fees - and they took our deposit (that they said they did not receive)). There was absolutely nothing in the apartment so, why did you charge for a trashbag? In our previous apartment unit, they charged $300 plus for a nail in the wall and carpet cleaning - cleaning they would normally do for each unit anyway - and for carpet that did NOT contain not one blemish or stain. This place is just a money pit. They CHARGE and CHARGE...but, take a look at the hallways, how they (do not) upkeep the buildings, the crime (yes - I will say it again) that occurs on the grounds. They claim this review is fraudulent but, if you live/lived there, you know what I mean...they sit in the office, look at their computers, and rack up the payments! They could care less about residents or the issues within the community - which is evident by their (lack of) action, over-billing, and deaf ears.\n\nOlder Review:\nIt appears Parkside has been removing some of their reviews.\nSo, I will add another one. Yesterday there were at least 15 Round Rock police officers in the complex, including SWAT - in a standoff for at least 4 hours. This is not acceptable. The management (2nd set since January of this year) need to be more mindful and selective of who they allow to move in...They are so focused on having 100% occupancy that they are not paying attention to red flags. The place is a hot mess.\n\nLooks good on the outside. On the inside the place is falling apart, literally.\n\nManagement is invisible within the community. On-site security is a joke. Some of the cameras on the property do not work. Our neighbor found this out the hard way when someone backed into her car. You get a different answer each time you enter the office - it depends on who to speak with. The staff follow-up is horrible. Trash piled up so high in the garages, it is ridiculous and the smell is horrible. The hallways contain blood, dog poop, dog hair, and other unmentionables. Maintenance shows up unannounced (even when no issue is reported).",

And my view is literally a chef's kiss. Great value for the price and super fab facilities all while being a stone's throw from beautiful east & downtown (if you're into that sorta thing). very clean when I moved in and already feels like home. Alexandria also goes out of her way to make folks feel included with various community activities etc.! a true shining star. Also S/O to the maintenance and pest control guys, they're 1-800-on-the-ball.\n\nMy only qualm would be that the towing company (that probably has an agreement w/ the building but idk) circle's the visitor lot each evening like blood-thirsty shahhks at feedin' time. It's extremely easy, (albeit slightly inconvenient) to register a guest's plate, make/model etc. on the app every time they visit- but also easy to forget and if you do- you're chum in the water my friend.\n\nI understand the towing company needs to get their bag, and this isn't the building per se, but  when I moved in my leg was broken so my sisters would come by a lot to help me out and I ran out of parking permits which sucked. Aside from that ONE inconvenient aspect, terrific experience.",

During my first few weeks here, I also noticed that even residents who live here seemed hesitant when walking me through the community. I tried to stay optimistic, but things have continued to go wrong.\n\nThey have repeatedly messed up my rent, and I\u2019ve had to go into the office multiple times to get it corrected. The hot water regularly goes out. Trash valet does not run nearly as smoothly as advertised. There are homeless individuals living in the dumpster area, and until very recently, there was no nighttime security at all. To be clear, they just hired nighttime security a couple of days ago, after months of ongoing issues reported by residents.\n\nThere are no security cameras in the hallways or parking lots because management claims it would be an \u201cinfringement of privacy,\u201d even though residents have repeatedly asked for basic safety measures. Packages go missing almost daily, despite management insisting their mail delivery system is \u201cfoolproof.\u201d It isn\u2019t. Someone\u2019s car was stolen (not towed\u2014stolen) from inside the gated parking lot.\n\nThe parking areas are constantly littered with residents\u2019 dog poop. I personally had a package stolen from the mailroom, and management admitted they have video footage of a homeless man entering and stealing packages. On top of that, my rental vehicle was towed even though I had a valid visitor permit.\n\nI\u2019ve lived here for less than two months and have experienced an unbelievable number of issues. There is an entire resident group chat that is nothing but daily complaints about how poorly this place is managed. I truly tried to stay positive and go with the flow, but I\u2019m exhausted by the constant problems and the lack of meaningful action from management.\n\nI do not recommend moving here.",

Huge island in the kitchen with white counter tops.\nVery new, paint is not chipped or gross.\nThe tubs are pretty big and wide.\nWalls in the units are pretty thick.\nThe pool/pool area is usually kept very clean\nThe building is About 10 minutes from the airport but you barley hear planes!\nThere\u2019s a community pool/billiards table.\nThere\u2019s a little market in the mail room full of snacks you can buy.\nThey\u2019ll do monthly community events like yoga or brunch!\n\nCONS:\nlots of security concern. Lots of package theft- even with their fetch service. Fetch has not the best hours too which aren\u2019t helpful if you work long days. Be prepared to buy a ring camera.\nShower water is finicky. Lots of water issues. Don\u2019t recommend if you love hot showers. This is my biggest issue\nWalking/parking near the dog park always smells like piss or poop :( people don\u2019t always use baggies to pick up the poop\nThe balconies that face the pool get COVERED in dust and dirt. It\u2019s hard to have furniture and plants.\nThey did a resident of the month event thing\u2026 and had an AI resident to win the prize \u2026\nThe hallways on the various floors are not cleaned often unless you ask them to clean it\n\nA lot of the reviews seem to be from people who only toured and haven\u2019t moved in so that made me wary\n\nFYI:\nBe very careful with guest parking because they always have tow trucks taking cars.\n\nApartment was not cleaned upon move in - BUT management did make it up to us with a credit towards our rent.\n\nIgnore reviews about grey star since kairoi is the new management.\n\nWith the X free weeks of move in deal, if you choose to Prorate rent it needs to be done manually with a money order. Can\u2019t be done through the app. Not awful just inconvenient.",

          "text": "This is the worst apartment I\u2019ve lived in for the price that they charge. Take recent reviews with a grain of salt because they capture the opinions of new residents rather than long term ones such as myself. On the surface it seems like a decent apartment. They have a nice business center, lobby, pool area, and rooftop. But I would say the praise ends there. Allen is the typically the one that responds to us the most so I will give them credit for that employee in specific.\n\nThere are systemic issues that only temporarily get fixed. Sometimes, the parking lot exit gates do not automatically open. The dog park is pathetic - it\u2019s small and has turf, which traps every type of smell from pet bathroom breaks. The residents as a whole don\u2019t care to pick up after their dogs. Consistent water pressure issues pop up every few months. Same with the elevator, which they don\u2019t care to fix permanently. Even when the elevator does work, there\u2019s always some sort of mess on the floor (the cleaning crew barely cleans it as is). The AC system gets overburdened and our electricity costs get driven up because it takes 2 hours to cool a small 1 bedroom. The printer periodically does not work. The staff does not care to upkeep the coffee machine. We went through a property management change where we switched from the horrendous Greystar to Kairoi. I will give the leasing office some credit for being a bit more responsive, however I don\u2019t think I should praise on-site staff for doing the bare minimum. They gave minimal notice when it came to the parking registration rules which is not legally complaint (I pointed it out and they did not respond) Given how they handle issues, I really don\u2019t think they care about improving the resident experience.

The lack of urgency from the maintenance team and the repeated breaking of the same things that have supposedly been fixed Is off the charts. For example, within the last three months, they have come to fix my microwave seven times. I understand that stuff happens although at some point, people are not doing their job. The leasing office Manager, Valerie is super dismissive of any issues and does the bare minimum to try and help out. The rest of the staff is really cool, although Valerie doesn\u2019t seem to value the tenant\u2019s time, money, or maintenance issues.

Again, having rented in Austin from greystar and maa for 7+ years I have never received a single lease violation, though after 4 months here have received 3.\n\nThe units themselves are fine aside from a major apartment wide mold issue l, but it\u2019s management that makes living in this community a complete nightmare. Management will find a reason to fine you at least once monthly. They overcharged me $70 for utilities and after months of back and forth where the leasing office assured me they would refund the mistake, the manager admitted he had no intention of doing this. There is a major issue with humidity in building one, leading many of the residents to find mold covering their clothes and shoes. I\u2019ve put in several work orders about abnormally high humidity levels (residents have reported upwards of 70% humidity recorded in unit) with no change. My walls and cabinets are often covered in condensation, and any paper goods in my unit are immediately damaged. If you\u2019re looking to get fined $50 for forgetting to bring your broom in after sweeping the patio of your apartment while the elevators, doors, and gates are constantly broken and the pool is constantly closed ( Don\u2019t forget about that mold issue) this is the place for you. If you like getting towed and receiving attitude from the leasing staff who will NOT refund you, or if you like it when your friends get towed (properly registered residents and visitors are often towed) or having your car stolen\u2026 this is a great place. I have never in my 7 years of renting dealt with such constant aggression and intense scrutiny from management and am excited to not renew my lease at this apartment.",

Nice pool with gas grills. One of the better onsite gyms I\u2019ve seen. Nice shared work space, lobby area and rooftop clubhouse but I don\u2019t really use those much. The ONE amenity I use daily is the large grass area behind the complex that we were permitted to use for our dogs. Lately, they decided that because of a report of a flea infestation months ago that through a series of supposed exchanges with the city, we aren\u2019t allowed to use the area any longer and doing so would be a lease violation. Having broken vehicle and pedestrian gates, doors within the community that don\u2019t lock properly, rampant package theft even with the forced use of Fetch package delivery service instead of the onsite lockers we used to use and sketchy vehicle transactions happening in the parking lot don\u2019t seem to be any concern to management. I brought a lot of these security concerns to management on April 6, 2023 and they still haven\u2019t been fixed but keeping my dog out of an area we\u2019ve used for two years is apparently more important.\n\nEDIT (01/08/2024): The security issues still remain but the complex has put a padlock on the gate into the large grass area that we use as an off-leash pet area.  I'm sure they'll say \"it was the city\" but the city isn't going to come out and unlock that gate when the landscapers come.  Stop lying.",

As we have told you and all residents previously, the detention pond and biofiltration system behind Nexus East is City of Austin property, and Nexus East is responsible for landscaping maintenance, pollution control, and ensuring controlled access. It is not - and has never been - a dog park, dog run, or amenity for residents, regardless of what previous management may have incorrectly told you. The City of Austin placed a placard stating that the area is not for public access, and we have locked the gates due to repeated unauthorized resident access to the area. We take our responsibility to the City of Austin seriously, as well as the overall maintenance of Nexus East, which is why the area has been secured. \n\nWith respect to your concerns regarding security, we are working to replace our pedestrian gate locks which have been previously replaced several times this year, and we work on a daily and weekly basis to ensure that the vehicle gates are operating correctly as well as the rest of the access points within the property. \n\nPlease feel free to reach out to us directly regarding your concerns and we will be happy to address them with you further. Thank you for your continued feedback and helping us ensure Nexus East is a comfortable place to live, and we hope to hear from you soon.\n\nNexus East",

          "text": "A Bewildering Experience at Nexus East Apartment Complex.\n\nI am writing this review to express my deep dissatisfaction with Nexus East Apartment Complex. While I initially moved in with high hopes, my experience has been marred by a series of frustrations and disappointments.\n\nFirstly, I've had several issues with the maintenance staff. On multiple occasions, they have entered my apartment without prior notice or while I was not present, which is a gross invasion of my privacy. The lack of respect for the personal space of tenants is extremely troubling.\n\nSecondly, the advertisement of a dog park and water retention park was a major selling point for me. However, this turned out to be false advertising. The so-called \"dog park\" is nothing more than a tiny patch of fake grass, and the \"water retention park\" is now non-existent. This misleading information is not only unethical but also a disservice to potential residents who are making decisions based on these amenities.\n\nLastly, and perhaps most concerning, is the issue with the complex's gates. They are frequently broken and remain open, allowing free access to the property. This lack of security has directly resulted in thefts in the complex. The management has shown little urgency or concern in addressing this significant safety issue.\n\nFurthermore, the customer service at Nexus East is deplorable. The management lacks accountability and has shown little to no interest in resolving the issues we have brought to their attention. Requests and complaints seem to fall on deaf ears, leaving us feeling ignored and undervalued as residents.\n\nIn conclusion, living at Nexus East Apartment Complex has been a frustrating and disappointing experience. The management's lack of regard for tenant rights, false advertisement of amenities, and poor customer service have made my stay here an ordeal. I strongly advise potential renters to consider these issues before choosing to live at Nexus East.",

We would like to discuss your concerns again in detail in person if you would like to have a meeting. As discussed before when requesting a maintenance request or pest control service this is you giving us permission to enter your home. Any other time we may enter you home would be due to required inspections per city requirements such as our Fire Inspections, etc. which we provide advance notices for. \n\nAs we have told you and all residents previously, the detention pond and biofiltration system behind Nexus East is City of Austin property, and Nexus East is responsible for landscaping maintenance, pollution control, and ensuring controlled access.  It is not - and has never been - a dog park, dog run, or amenity for residents, regardless of what previous management may have incorrectly told you. The City of Austin placed a placard stating that the area is not for public access, and we have locked the gates due to repeated unauthorized resident access to the area. We take our responsibility to the City of Austin seriously, as well as the overall maintenance of Nexus East, which is why the area has been secured. \n\nWith respect to your concerns regarding security, we are working to replace our pedestrian gate locks which have been previously replaced several times this year, and we work on a daily and weekly basis to ensure that the vehicle gates are operating correctly as well as the rest of the access points within the property. \n\nPlease feel free to reach out to us directly regarding your concerns and we will be happy to address them with you further. Thank you for your continued feedback and helping us ensure Nexus East is a comfortable place to live, and we hope to hear from you soon.",

          "text": "CHOOSE SOMEWHERE ELSE!\n\nI usually give places the benefit of the doubt, but this was a really awful experience at these apartments. The staff is constantly changing. Some are very nice, but there are some VERY rude members even when you are trying to be polite and cordial.\n\nThe apartments are new, but are very cheaply made. The cabinets and doors are thin and easily broken. The large sinks are not set right so they do not drain and accumulate water and grime. The washing machine sets off the breaker every other time, so if you try doing a was while gone or over night you will find your clothes sitting, submerged in water. Insects and bugs are everywhere. They fill the semi-open air stairwells. The stairwells are NEVER cleaned of trash, spills, or spiderwebs. In 2 bedrooms the AC is near the guest room and gets that room very cold while the rest of the apartment gets no AC. No vent valves to redirect air.\n\nThen there are the Air B&Bers. The apartment puts up its own units on air b&b for extra income. This means that there is a constant flow of travelers who get locked outside, trash the stairwells and hallways, and never put their trash out right so that the trash service won't take it and it will sit there in the hallways with nothing done to it for weeks. They also bring their dogs which have attacked other tenants with no repercussions\n\nFinally, when I moved out they sent me a bill for $1400 owed after deposit. I used a cleaning service, but they charged me with $200 \"Heavy Cleaning\" fee and $750 for new carpet and padding. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the carpet.\n\nThis was one of the most disappointing rental experiences I have ever had. The Nexus is WAYYY over priced for what you get. I would pick the next apartment on your list.",

My daughter has rented here for almost a year now and it has been one problem after another. 2 major floods (she lives on the bottom floor) due to upstairs units having pipe breaks and toilet issues. More often than not she has to live in inhumane conditions such as loud fans for water and mold remediation 24-7, construction work tearing out walls etc. The management wouldn\u2019t pay for a hotel the first time it flooded. second time they offered a smaller apt that is not large enough for their furniture (her and her roommate work from home). Packages are frequently stolen. You will get late fees and eviction notices if the payment portal is down. Pathetic excuse for an apartment complex. Save yourself a lot of headaches and try to find a better managed apartment if you can!",

We take all feedback very seriously here, especially when related to a water leak like this. We have been working since this incident occurred to assist your daughter to the best of our ability and make this right. While we cannot provide you directly with additional details, we are moving her to a larger unit - not a smaller one - for the time being, and she will be able to return to her original unit as requested once repairs are completed.\n\nWe understand that this is a difficult and stressful situation and want the process to move as quickly and smoothly as possible. We welcome you and your daughter to reach out to us at our office regarding further concerns so that we can address them while we work to resolve this and will do what we can to assist. We greatly appreciate your feedback, and it is our goal and intent to make every resident experience here at Nexus East as high-quality as possible, even when incidents like this happen.",

As time has moved on and new management has taken over the building my experience and living situation here has drastically diminished.\n- I have barely had hot water and lacking water pressure at times to my apt going on about two months now\n- I can't turn on my hair dryer with both bathroom lights on without my fuse breaking every single time (have to use dimmed light with only 1 on)\n- the layout in the  1bd has a funky layout where the two bathroom doors collide into each other.\n- this community does NOT provide lock out help outside of business hours. Their response/advice to residents is don't lose or have your property stolen/taken.\n- this is an airbnb heavy community which can raise safety and noise concerns\n- cars have been broken into\n- package rooms have been broken into\n\nHonestly some of these things are whatever and I can deal with and have, but as the list keeps growing they are beginning to snowball and create a horrible living experience that is now starting to impact daily life (NO HOT WATER)",

          "text": "6/30/24 UPDATE: The entire complex is in disarray, heaps of dog poop EVERYWHERE, Kids toys, Trash, bird poop covering stairs, Lights knocked over, Broken lights, If you own a vehicle, You\u2019ll soon realize why EVERY vehicle has a theft proof cover over their license plate, One of the Tenants that\u2019s lived here as long as I have, Stole my tag and put it on his vehicle. Then aggressively confronted us for calling the cops on his poor choices. Its the weekend before 4th of July and our pool is neon green, Again. Palm Tree seed pods are covering the pool. If this place was maintained properly, They would know Palm Trees need to be trimmed before they start to seed or it can cause bigger problems. 6/19/2023 UPDATE: It\u2019s Monday and Richie can\u2019t seem to answer the phone. SHOCKER! We just passed Father\u2019s Day weekend with a green pool- OUR ONLY AMENITY we pay for looks like shrecks swamp water. We have broken parking lot lights that have been like this for over a month, That could cause serious injury. Talking with a neighbor, Turns out we don\u2019t have a maintenance man either!!!! Pathetic\u2026. Allll these issues and the office manager trots around telling everyone he now lives on property, all while he literally can\u2019t even answer the phone, Nor take care of the property.\n\n11/3/22 UPDATE: Bianca the so called \u201coffice lady\u201d STILL won\u2019t answer the phone NOR follow up with broken appliances. THEY DONT FIX ANYTHING. Can you say GHETTO?  Now owned by a NEW OWNER. We were notified by once again, Changing the requirements of HOW we pay rent, Keep in mind it\u2019s costing extra just TO GET RENT PAID. I am in a Lease, The new company is charging extra. As for Jasmine Womack\u2019s review, You give a place that has ROACHES 3 stars? Ew. Have a higher expectations.\n\nThis property does not value the tenants that reside here. Every month it\u2019s a huge hassle to even pay rent. They keep changing what kind of payment they will accept, with that every month each method has hidden fees. They are essentially pushing us to have no other option than Auto-Pay. I could see using Auto pay if this was a luxury apartment, but we pay for a green pool, no gym or grills & unimaginable dirty property. See pics below for proof. We pay over $1500 a month for a neon green pool.(Dont forget the hidden fees to even pay your rent)  I asked temp office manager as to why we don\u2019t have a gym when there\u2019s been a gym here for over 10 years, What WAS a gym is now turned into a dirty storage room. Bianca the new office manager is quite literally useless. She doesn\u2019t answer numerous phone calls, nor emails I\u2019ve sent.",

I asked for the Admin fee back since a apartment wasn\u2019t going to be held for me anyways and they never called back or refunded me. So I paid $200 for them to call me and say they wouldn\u2019t let me have an apartment unless I paid the rent plus cost of rent for the deposit and never get the admin fee back.

Submitted a request for a scheduled tour on Tuesday over the weekend (they are closed Saturday and Sunday), and started receiving automated promotional emails immediately. Did not hear from staff on Monday or Tuesday, but received an automated email at 7pm on Monday inviting me to tour during their open house \u201ctoday at 1pm!\u201d No dates listed, and I still hadn\u2019t received a response, so I arrived at the office around 1:30pm on Tuesday when I had originally hoped to take a tour. The office manager Richy seemed to immediately recognize me (my emailed request), and knew I was looking for a two bedroom. Explained that he didn\u2019t have a single unit available to tour on the whole property until the next day. I explained that I have a busy work schedule and couldn\u2019t fit anything in until the following week, but was very interested in seeing any unit (even if it wasn\u2019t the layout I was looking to rent). He told me to email him with my availability for the following week, which I did within three hours of leaving the office. It has been over 48 hours and I have not heard anything from the management team. Disappointed, as the property appears to be well maintained and I love the floor plans offered. I\u2019ve lived in dozens of apartments in my life and know that if I can\u2019t get a response from management before I\u2019ve even moved in, there\u2019s no way I\u2019d receive prompt assistance if there were issues during my lease.",

          "text": "Moved into my unit in October '25 and I have nothing but wonderful things to say about my entire experience so far!\n\nDuring my initial tour, Patrick was just wonderful to work with! He answered all my questions and helped me apply on the spot. Before move-in, Patrick, Micaela, and Joshua in the front office allowed me to move my move-in date with no issues and rushed to clean my unit after the old tenant moved out so it was in great shape for me to move-in. It was such a great experience i even extended my lease before move-in day! The garage is gated and i've yet to see the gate break down (my old complex had gate issues every other day), there's plenty of parking, and I've seen private security walking the garage overnight!\n\nSince I've moved in, i've had a couple maintenance \"issues\" (regular apartment stuff) that the maintenance team has gone ABOVE & BEYOND for! My requests are reviewed same-day and either resolved or addressed by the next day. Amir is responsive, knowledgeable, and exactly who you want to help you with any surprise maintenance needs! Just, the best!\n\nThe *only* thing I'll say to be aware of is if you're living on the east side or close to downtown, you have to be prepared for some acts of vandalism (as you do in most cities). There's only been one instance of vandalism in our garage since my move-in but even then, the front office team handled it wonderfully! They sent out an email alerting tenants, immediately hired daytime security, and even helped my friend check on my car as I was out of town when this occurred.\n\nA long review to say, i would definitely recommend living here or anywhere this team manages! Thank you!",

Recently, my entire sink collapsed unexpectedly, and the maintenance team handled the situation with urgency and professionalism. Amir came by the very next day to assess the issue and immediately coordinated a contractor to get everything repaired.\n\nNot only did they install a brand-new sink, but they also replaced the entire floor in the area which had a bit of water damage, and the work was done quickly and with great attention to detail. Throughout the whole process, Amir checked in, communicated clearly, and made sure everything was resolved to a high standard.\n\nThe level of service here has always been consistent, and this experience is just another example of why I\u2019ve chosen to stay at 7East for so long. Big shoutout to Amir for going above and beyond. His professionalism, kindness, and follow-through truly make a difference. Highly recommend living here!",

The walls are extremely thin \u2014 I could hear footsteps from the room above throughout the day and night, and every night around midnight, someone in the hallway had loud phone conversations that continued despite me asking them to lower their voice.\n\nRoad noise is constant, and the view from my room was of a vacant parking lot that felt unsafe, with visible signs of homelessness and people sleeping on the pavement. The adjacent 7-Eleven has a flashing blue security light and a voice-activated \u201cno loitering\u201d announcement that goes off frequently, adding to the discomfort.\n\nThe room itself was passable but felt cheaply furnished. I had looked forward to relaxing by the pool, but the hot tub jets didn\u2019t work, the furniture was dirty and neglected, and the main pool had visible dirt at the bottom \u2014 clearly not maintained regularly.\n\nI\u2019ve included photos to show the reality, which is far from what the listing portrayed. I travel to Salt Lake City often for work and had hoped this could be a go-to spot for future stays, but based on this experience, I won\u2019t be returning.",

From an increase in community events, to maintaining communication with residents, and improved maintenance. Overall residents are friendly and welcoming easy to converse and get to know or simply say hello to.  Great community structure all around.",

From day one, the staff has been genuinely helpful and easy to work with\u2014especially Duncan and Wyatt. They made the move-in process smooth, answered every question we had, and have continued to be super responsive any time we need anything.\n\nThe building itself feels clean, well cared for, and the design/decor is modern without trying too hard\u2014really comfortable and welcoming. The amenities have been a huge bonus too. The common areas are great for relaxing (TV lounges, firepits, and plenty of seating), and having BBQ grills, a pool and hot tub, plus a solid fitness center makes it feel like you\u2019re getting perks you\u2019ll actually use\u2014not just \u201cnice on paper.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve also been impressed with maintenance. They\u2019ve been quick to fix things and communication has been clear the whole time. It\u2019s always easy to get ahold of the team, which is honestly rare these days.\n\nLocation-wise, it\u2019s hard to beat\u2014close to Temple Square and all the downtown Salt Lake attractions. And inside the apartment, it\u2019s surprisingly quiet. We feel safe here and really happy with our choice.

Around 6 a.m. a constant tapping started, which I believe are the pipes, and it hasn\u2019t stopped (currently 0920). To top everything off the AC sounds like a vacuum.\n\nDuncan was a great salesman and very helpful, so I\u2019d give him 5 stars but the unit\u2019s overall quality is far below what I expected.

The gym area is nice, the clubhouse and office work spaces are always well kept and really useful. They throw 2-3 fun events every month for the residents as well. And especially with the new management everything has been running smoother. They communicate well and are always ready to answer any questions we have. The fire alarms are always mentioned and it is very annoying when it goes off, but it seems to be less frequent with the new management team and when it has gone off, within 12-16 hours we get an email telling us what happened and what triggered the alarm. I would really recommend this place to anyone looking for an apartment!",

I was particularly impressed by Samantha as she was a true professional with her job and strives for nothing below excellent service to help out all residents the best she can. I also give thanks to the rest of the team such as Anthony, the lady at the front, and the maintenance team who has been nothing but timely with all requests up until now. I am hopeful this management team will continue taking care of the heights to the best of their ability.\n\nThis building is old, fire alarms continue to be an infrastructure problem management and residents have to deal with, but all things considered I think this is still a great place to live at. The views continue to take my breath away, and though I wish the trash rooms would be cleaner at times I am still happy to be living at the heights.",

          "text": "RUN FAST. RUN FAR! I have never been treated so shabbily unprofessionally by a leasing complex or company. Documentation was disregarded. Strong-armed into paying additional fines under threat of credit reporting.\n\nI would leave 0 stars if I could. When I was living at Elan Keller Ranch I had some problems. When I moved in in July of '22 as scheduled, the apartment was not properly cleaned. There were cobwebs, the carpet had stains. I documented this in the move-in inspection form. The door handled to the patio door was not properly affixed, the liner on the door was coming off. There was standing water in the apartment from hosing the stairway.  I left this in review and put work orders in. I had to put multiple work orders in to get these issues addressed - and the cobwebs, and the carpet was never addressed. I even left a documented review. Nothing. I decided to move on.\n\nThe next year a very loud family moved in above me rough housing, and loud noises, running children in the middle of the night. I made multiple complaints but this continued. I was told to contact the after hours police liaison, who told me to call 911 if I suspected someone was in danger. No one was to my knowledge (just loud roughhousing, children playing running, jumping at all hours of the night) and so my hands were tied. I continued to make complaints with no resolution.\n\nI moved out in July of '24. I payed about 30% of a month's leasing charges to cover the week that I would be staying. I asked for a summary of charges in advance for the 7 days but they would not furnish me the charges. Not willing to pay a whole month's worth of the lease but not wanting the bank transfer to be marked as late, I estimated the charges at about 30% of the total monthly lease charges (this is the first 7 days out of the month that I was living there before moving out, mind you). I had everything moved out and professionally move-out cleaned by Spruce, the recommended and even sponsored cleaning company of Elan Keller Ranch. Everything was pristine, even the cobwebs were gone. Carpet was the same from move in, but cleaner. No mention of move-out inspection.\n\nWhen I asked for my deposit back a month later I was told there were charges. The condition sink was devalued and the carpet needed to be replaced because of my use. I showed them the review after moving in - nothing. When I tried to get into touch to ask more questions, and for photos of of the sink, no reply. I called and e-mailed multiple times, nothing. Then I heard from the collection agency. I pointed towards my comments on the move-in inspection - they ignored that. There was nothing I could do because I hadn't set a move-out inspection appointment. I cited \"normal wear and tear\" clause as it appeared in my lease, as I knew it had had one. They told me they couldn't speak to that but then cited me the part of my lease that told me I needed to make a move-out inspection appoint if I didn't want to be charged after move out. Because the lease was in their online portal and I was no longer a tenant, they would not provide me a copy of my lease to reference this personally. They said I had the option to dispute, but then said in all honesty it would likely not be successful because of the lack of inspection. I had the documentation and they ignored it. I felt strong-armed into paying because I don't have the fees required for an attorney. They also said that this lack of payment had not be reported to the credit agencies YET, implying that if I did not pay they would. When I asked about if the dispute process would somehow be reflected in my credit score, they told me they couldn't answer that as that would be considered legal advice. Awful experience.",

          "text": "I have lived at Elan Keller for 2 years, and decided not to renew my lease. When I first moved in everyone was so friendly, and welcoming. Some neighbors I\u2019ve met I\u2019m still friends with til this day. A lot of good perks for the area.\n\nIn my first year here, it seemed they could never keep a leasing agent. Each time I went into the office it was always someone new. They would never answer the phone, and were rude when they did. The property and the amenities were rarely maintained. Buildings on the inside were dirty from bugs, birds, weather, and people\u2019s trash spillage on the concert. No one would pick up after their dogs, pool furniture continuously broken. The courtesy officer never coming to assist with complaints. If he did respond it would be hours later, or tell you to call the police. It was all very frustrating to live here.\n\nTowards the middle to end of my second year of living here. I believe they brought in Andrea Gallegos. Things then started to change. The property was getting regularly maintained. The grass being cut, building cleanings, pool being cleaned more, consistent valet trash pick ups, etc. Once she arrived I truly stopped complaining to myself and friends that this place was a mess. She might not have been the only person to turn this place around, but for me it seemed like she the main factor. When I would go to the office I would get 2 different answers on a question. Which was frustrating as well. I went to ask her my same questions, and she was very polite along with informative. Ms. Gallegos definitely knows her stuff and cares about her residents. Now my only continuous issue is parking, but a few steps never hurt anyone.\n\nOverall, the property and its management team I feel have come along way. I would recommend to live here.\n\nPros: close grocery store options, restaurants/bars, walking trails, coffee shops, etc.\n\nCons: Thin walls, loud neighbors, pet droppings on property, no parking, and right gate continuously broken.",

          "text": "Update: they terminated my renewal after three years and won\u2019t disclose why.\n\nWhere do I even begin. I have been a tenant since 2021. So buckle up!\n\nI moved here in 2021 where management was absolutely AMAZING. Sheradon ( I probably spelt her name wrong) was on top of everything, made sure every tenant was having a great experience, catering to people\u2019s needs quickly and efficiently. There was an issue of my upstairs neighbor putting a heavy amount of water onto her floors that leaked thru my ceiling after I just had baby, she had maintenance come fix it right away (Josh is a great maintenance man here. And had the situation settled in no time. ) Then womp womp here comes new management..\n\nI had to move into a two bedroom for more room in a very small amount of time since my lease was ending and I needed more space, Anjanette helped me in a timely manner and made me really happy. When I moved in I noticed my sink was completely cracked .. and just a lot of maintenance issues within the apartment itself. DOCUMENT EVERYTHING. TAKE PICTURES. Do NOT talk to them about it over the phone. WRITE IT ON THE MOVE IN SHEET IF SOMETHING IS WRONG. thank god I had a saved conversation about the sink between the maintenance man on my phone because they were saying I HAD TO PAY FOR IT WHEN I WAS NOT THE ONE WHO DID IT. Saying I had to replace the whole sink and what not\u2026 as soon as I showed them that I had proof of the maintenance man saying he was supposed to contact a different contractor to fix it and never did.. they said they would take care of it.. but just resurface it at a cheaper rate for themselves.. how ironic.. I lost all of their trust after that little act.\n\nParking. GOOD LUCK. It is a war zone. Come 645 if you\u2019re not home (god forbid you work) .. you will not be parking by your complex.. people hog parking spots with multiple cars and guests don\u2019t park outside the gate like they\u2019re supposed to. Also the stickers don\u2019t work half the time for the gate to open. So yep. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb not enough parking. That\u2019s my biggest anxiety trigger since living here. Not enough spots(they don\u2019t even have carports near buildings 9/10)\n\nDog poop. People don\u2019t pick up after their dogs. At all.\n\nTrash valet is a hit or miss (will forget your building completely most of the time)\n\nGet charged with so many fees so be prepared to pay for $300 worth of amenities that aren\u2019t even consistent (random charges every month)\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve lived in my two bedroom and my filter still hasn\u2019t been replaced OH and they want me to pay for a new water filter on my fridge since I\u2019m not a new tenant LOL.\n\nBe prepared to hear conversations thru the wall since the walls are thin and people don\u2019t care about silent hours.\n\nSpeeding is also a problem . No one slows down even with kids being out.\n\nI had to renew my lease unfortunately since my other plans of moving fell thru but I will say this, Anjanette did help me renew my lease even after I put in my 60 day notice which I am grateful for. Also Alex is very sweet and actually gets things done as soon as you ask him when you walk into the leasing office. He has helped me with several things and I am also very grateful for his great attitude / customer service.\n\nAll in all.. dear lord.. it\u2019s been a ROUGH 3 years.. but the parking situation.. HAS GOT TO CHANGE.\n\nGood luck to anyone who moves in.",

          "text": "I recently had a highly unsatisfactory experience working with Andrea Gallegos. From the beginning, it was clear that she lacked the necessary professionalism, competence, and dedication to providing quality customer service. We lost over 400$ in application fees and administrative fees because of their verification system called Snappt but perhaps the most disappointing aspect of my experience was Andrea (manager) indifferent attitude and lack of care. She displayed minimal interest in assisting with error I was having with Snappt if you google the company and read the reviews you can clearly see tons of applicants with the same problem which I tried to explain but she was more concerned with putting her office chair together when I went in . I felt as if I stepped into the 1950s. Honestly, I\u2019m sooooo thankful we dodge the bullet the lack of enthusiasm and effort made me question their commitment to their role and their willingness to provide quality service to residents. I had the pleasure of touring a real luxury complex called Sire Wellington if I was still in the market for an apartment I would definitely choose them please reach out to Victoria and let her know that Dawn referred you , they won\u2019t disappoint!\n\nUpdate * I responded and sent an email to the one listed below but unfortunately it\u2019s just the apartment manger trolling I\u2019m guessing they have to respond but I assure you nothing was resolved",

          "text": "After nearly three years of living here and never once complaining there has been someone in our building for months that has been playing loud bass music throughout all hours of the night that is so loud it can be heard through a pillow smashed onto my head and can be heard on my phone videos after echoing into our bedroom. I have multiple emails of these videos from all different dates ranging from 1 in the morning  to sometimes 5 in the morning and sent these after speaking to the manager in person and showing her her exact response was \u201c wow that is such a deep sound can you send me more videos of it\u201d the only thing she has done is emailed people in our building to ask if it\u2019s them which of course everyone has said no and told us to call the police who can do nothing if they don\u2019t know which exact building it\u2019s coming from. Their only offer was to break our lease or move us into a smaller apartment and told my husband there was nothing else she could do since we\u2019re the only ones being affected by it. We shouldn\u2019t be the ones who have to move because someone else is violating their lease by playing loud music throughout all hours of the night almost every single night. I definitely wouldn\u2019t recommend living here because even though you pay nearly 2,000 a month for a one bedroom apartment and have never had issues before if something \u201cis only affecting you\u201d they will not care at all.\n\nThis is an update to this review. Within about an hour of leaving my review I received a call from the manager of Elan Keller Ranch asking why I was \u201cleaving such a nasty review\u201d for her. Nothing about my review was nasty as it was purely stating the situation we have been dealing with and the lack of effort and communication put towards resolving this prolonged noise issue. Not only have I been experiencing severe anxiety the last month due to the lack of sleep, and wondering how much real sleep, if any, my husband and I will be able to get before heading to work the next morning. It has now only been heightened by the manager calling to accuse me of being nasty, and accusing us of not doing our part to stop the noise\u2026utterly ridiculous. This is all very confusing to me considering we have more than a dozen recordings of the noise to prove that the issue is actually occurring including additional recordings at the request of the complex manager, my husband has attempted to knock on multiple door with no one answering the door, and we have repeatedly raised the issue to the manager, an issue which dealing with is well within the scope of responsibility for the manager of an apartment complex. What also makes this ridiculous is the fact that the majority of the communication has been through our emails sent to her which pretty consistently require my husband or I taking the initiative. Responses were typically inconsistent or would only occur as a result of my husband or I going to the front office in person to follow up. These are nice apartments to live in but after experiencing this complete lack of professionalism and effort from the management of the complex I would highly recommend prospective tenants steer clear at all costs. Unfortunately it is not feasible for us to move right now do to our life schedule which we are not able to adjust at the moment or for the foreseeable future, and furthermore shouldn't have to.",

          "text": "Update: 11/27/2025\nMaking yet another update to my review on my continued great experiences as a tenant at the stonewood apartments homes here in Temecula.\nI'm probably repeating myself at this point but I really can't get over on how much of a change that has been at these apartments since I moved in about 8 to 9 years ago. It was pretty rough in the beginning but this new team is just amazing. All the ladies on the office team are there to greet you with a warm smile and an open ear. They actually listen, how many folks can say in 2025 your apartment complex is looking out for you?\nAnd that office team is backed by an equally as awesome and amazing maintenance team Wayne, Ernesto & every single one of the gentlemen that work on the maintenance team are great and awesome in their own right. I have been lucky enough to have every single one of the gentlemen working my apartment at one time or another for general routine maintenance.\nAs much as you all say thank you to us I wanted to say thank you to all of you for making my continued experience here awesome I look forward to MANY more happy years here with y'all.\nThank you to the entire stonewood apartment homes team and staff for your continued kinship and warm rapport  with my family and I.\n\n________________________________________\nAugust 9th 2023:\nWell just want to make a quick update to my review. I'm going on now almost 7 years and I'm still loving the Stonewood apartments. Though the staff changes the folks who do come are always fabulous and the current team is even better than that. Big shout out to all the ladies in the leasing office.\nAlso want to make a quick shout out to the new maintenance staff member his name is Josh, this gentleman did an outstanding job in my apartment and I wanted to give him a public shout out for that. Anyone planning on moving to the stone woods I've been here now 7 years and counting and I don't have any complaints or plans on moving.\n\nThanks again to ALL the staff, y'all are all awesome.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJust want to take time and say that I really appreciate the staff here at the stonewood apts. Irma and all the staff are just great. Ready to listen when we have a concern or issue and always promptly responding to any issues and concerns.\nI have been here for many years now and hope to continue to have many more.\nThank you and have a blessed day\n\nUpdate!! So I'm going on a little over 5 years and still loving living here, the office staff are still so pleasant to talk to and the maintenance staff is equally just as nice and pleasant to have come and fix things in your apartment. Anyone interested in living in the Temecula area should come check it out most definitely!",

          "text": "Living at The Hunter has been one of those rare experiences where every detail, from the moment you walk into the building to the way the light hits your apartment in the late afternoon, feels intentionally designed to elevate daily life. Even in early December, with the crisp Colorado air outside, our 7th-floor apartment radiates warmth, calm, and effortless elegance.\n\nThe extra-tall ceilings immediately transform the space. Light stretches upward and bounces off the quartz countertops, stainless steel appliances, the beautiful kitchen backsplash, and the wood-look flooring. Every corner feels open, airy, and thoughtfully designed. The stackable in-unit washer and dryer, garages, and additional storage options make everyday life smooth, convenient, and unexpectedly luxurious.\n\nThe layout options are vast, accommodating a variety of lifestyles, and the balcony is genuinely a private retreat. City views in one direction, mountains in the other \u2014 morning coffee, evening sunsets, or just pausing for a quiet moment feel elevated every single time. The apartment feels luxurious without being ostentatious, yet somehow still manages to feel like home.\n\nThe amenities go far beyond what one expects from an apartment community. Fitness and movement studios with embroidered towels that somehow make you feel fancy, coworking and conference/Zoom rooms that feel modern and professional, a heated pool and hot tub that are essentially resort-level, and yes, a golf simulator \u2014 every detail has been thoughtfully executed. Pet-friendliness is extreme, smart building technology is seamless, and the little touches really set The Hunter apart: custom-named Hunter mugs at the coffee station, embroidered towels in the fitness areas, welcome-home bags, branded pens, and the intercom system that lets guests in without a hitch \u2014 all adding layers of polish and thoughtfulness that make everyday living feel elevated.\n\nThe staff at The Hunter make the experience even better. Stephanie guided us flawlessly through our lease and moving process, and while Kyla wasn\u2019t our direct agent, her helpfulness is felt throughout the building. Vanessa, the property director, manages the community with professionalism and warmth, and Chris in maintenance is consistently prompt, friendly, and effective. Together, they make the building feel genuinely cared for, not just managed.\n\nThe location is ideal: central to downtown Colorado Springs, restaurants, shops, and entertainment, yet tucked back enough to be peaceful and private. You get all the energy of downtown without the hustle and chaos. I had a hard time finding anything wrong \u2014 every detail has been thoughtfully executed, every convenience accounted for.\n\nThe Hunter even makes the little things feel like a treat. The payment portal is seamless and stress-free, the user-friendly apps make scheduling, rent, and community access effortless, and the intercom adds a level of convenience that makes welcoming guests feel effortless. Honestly, this is the kind of apartment that makes your friends jealous the moment they step in: from the light-filled interiors to the balcony views, the luxe finishes, the thoughtfully curated amenities, and the smart tech everywhere, it\u2019s a living experience that elevates daily life without trying too hard.\n\nIf you want to live somewhere that makes you feel like you leveled up in life just by walking through the door\u2026 The Hunter is it.",

          "text": "Update: We have since moved out, but the Quinci was by far the worst \"luxury living\" community I've ever been in. Homeless, package theft, illegal parking at all times of day, off leash animals, fake reviews from employees of Kairoi, and a horrible location. Right now it seems the rent is effectively ~1700 a month, which is what I'd say it's worth. Rather than the 2450 they gave us for our lease renewal.\n\nWhere to even begin...To preface this review, Mikayla, Angel, and Josue are all great to work with. Moving in was easy. My partner and I have been at The Quinci for 4 months now and it has been by far the worst renting experience of our lives.\n\nUpon move in, we were given information from previous property director Brittani about the timelines and capabilities of the amenities. These timelines were completely unfounded, as nothing besides the pickleball courts are currently available and we are a good portion through our lease already. Had we of known this, we would have chosen to live elsewhere.\u00a0We are currently living in a CONSTANT construction zone, which shakes the buildings nearly everyday from 7am-4pm.\n\nWithin the past 4 months we have encountered the following issues (from least to most recent):\n1. Some extremely inconsiderate tenants that trash the property with their cigarette butts and garbage\n2. Off leash dogs roaming the property, sometimes with no owners in sight whatsoever\n3. German cockroaches, which, hopefully, is now completely remedied.\n4. Mailboxes weren't available to use for over 2 months of our lease. requiring us to drive to the airport post office to collect our mail, or wait for Mikayla to graciously collect it for us once a week.\n5. Ant infestation. Now remedied.\n6. Water heater wasn't turned on upon moving in, leaving us without hot water.\n7. Bedroom door couldn't latch when closing\n8. Charging station for electric vehicles still in development with no timelines or estimates in sight\n9. Pickleball court lights only recently installed, over 3 months into our lease term\n10. The grills are still not functional even though they're \"Installed\"\n11. Rent has now decreased on this property over $200 a month and $300 a month for the 3 bedrooms.\n\nLastly, and the MOST important issue of all (as of late) is the complete repaving and re-construction of all of the driveways and entrances to our garages throughout the property due to it not being up to code for drainage. This is likely to leave us without access to our garages for well over a month, initially starting in early/mid October and supposedly ending mid November (originally expected end of October) with no consolation to the tenants from upper management. This has caused us to need to haul our groceries, gear, equipment, etc. 600 feet through construction each day. it's an enormous inconvenience to us as tenants, that the property owners couldn't care less about.\n\nMikayla has been a great help in hearing our complaints and helping us through so many of the issues we've had here. Unfortunately, enough is enough, and The Quinci is deserving of nothing more than the rating given. I highly encourage anyone reading this review and considering The Quinci to reconsider and move somewhere else more stable.",

The rooms are immaculate but the Rules are just too much for employed people. The limitation on the number of people and the time limit on visitors is their only downfall.. The fact that LUNA accommodates grown adults that are working it should give you the freedom to sign your visitors if and when you want too. Even if we have to pay for a visitor that needs to check out at 10am that I signed in at 3am its ok\u2026 honestly thats their only downfall\u2026 the visitors part, the limitation on daily visitors should go back to 2 and the time should be unlimited, like it was when they first introduced the app. R110 is nothing just to accommodate family/or whoever that arrives at Luna. As long as the money is paid.",

I found it convenient living close to a Target, HomeGoods, HEB, BlackRock Coffee and MovieHouse Eatery.

          "text": "Not terrible, but not great either. The actual unit I have is fine, happy with it, wasn't cleaned properly by the time I arrived but can look past it (just some scruffs and finger marks on appliances). Community is nice and inviting, and its pretty quiet. Seems like working professionals around the same age group. Its a good part of town too. Wish the parking situation for guests (or lackthereof) could be improved but given where it is in town this isn't really management's fault or problem to be fair, and the unit is nice enough to again overlook that.\n\nThe elevator closest to my unit doesn't work, and the one that does work is painfully slow. I just take the stairs now to the 4th floor but sill given the price I'd expect that to be done. Also was a pain for the movers and as a result I probably ended up paying a little more than originally anticipated. Again, can overlook this for the time being assuming the other elevator will be fixed (believe it will be based on communication I've received)\n\nThe leasing office itself leaves a bit to be desired. I'm not sure what the capacity the building(s) is (are) currently at, but it's certainly nowhere near full, so the fact they get overwhelmed with simple things like parking is pretty concerning. Today I was told by the Director via email that I wasn't permitted to park in the garage and wasn't part of my lease (it is actually part of my lease, they later confirmed it), and that I would be towed if I don't add it to my lease by 3:00PM (of course no apology for the threat).\n\nThen the assistant director called me separately at around almost the exact same time saying that I was in the wrong spot and my spot was a spot over (how can this be true if the director claimed I have no spot). I told her that I don't think that's the case but could I move it when I get back from work, to which I was basically told 'no', and that it again could be towed and they wanted to avoid a \"chain reaction\" and get it taken care of as quickly as possible. Well, I drop everything I'm doing at work and walk 20 minutes down to the apartment and get in the garage and surprise surprise my car is in the RIGHT SPOT. I called the Asst. Director back and asked why I just dropped everything and came down for what they were basically pitching as an emergency when in reality  they were making problems where there was literally no issue - they screwed up two times in a row.\n\nThe Asst. Director, Tatum, basically took little accountability and seemed confused and miffed as to why I would be upset with the situation, then gave an insincere 'sorry', as if she didn\u2019t know what she was apologizing for, which was a little strange. Again, important to remember that it wasn't a situation where they said 'please just move it tonight and check when you get back', it was instead pitched as it needed handled now in the middle of a workday.",
