I tried to give them some grace and the benefit of the doubt but it had been over two months since I was owed my deposit and I have yet to receive it. I have been either given the run around and told I would get a call back (which I didn’t) or I’m asked to email them and they never respond back. I have evidence of the emails where they didn’t respond and call recordings with contradictions Aboit when they sent out the check. I will update this thread when I finally get a response and my refund. Used to be a great place to live, completely different experience. Also, they said I owed them money until I showed them that I paid my rent. I’m sure if I took this long to pay them, it wouldn’t be acceptable. Lastly, it seems like a breach of contract in their reimbursement method because it changed from what it was before when I signed.",

Staff are rude to tenants and email language to tenants is passive aggressive for things outside of their control. An example recently was from a notice of external facing doors of the property and a message was sent out saying tenants would be liable if found to leave the doors open.  The catch though - the doors are broken. Some don't even have a Spring Hinge/Self Closing Gate Hinge. They also don't work with the key fobs. Highly recommend any tenant to look elsewhere.",

Any community reminders are meant to protect those shared experiences, not to place blame.\n\nAs for the hallways and overall building care, we’re continuing to take steps to improve cleanliness and reinforce our non-smoking policies — because we want Parkside to feel like home for every resident.\n\nWe know the past few years have come with challenges, and while we may not always get it right the first time, we truly care and are constantly working to do better.

I had a faulty kitchen sink faucet once and the next day, maintenance replaced the entire faucet with a brand new one.

          "text": "I've been living at Parkside at Round Rock for about a year now and I can’t recommend it enough! The customer service here is truly outstanding. From the moment I moved in, the leasing agent, assistant manager, and property manager have gone above and beyond to make sure all my needs are met. They’re incredibly attentive, always ready to help with a smile, which really makes a difference in the overall experience of living here.\n\nThe apartments themselves are spacious and well-designed, offering fantastic value for the price. I love how much room I have to spread out, and the layouts are perfect for both relaxation and entertaining.\n\nOne of my favorite features is the dog park! It’s a wonderful space where my pups can play and socialize with other dogs. Plus, the dog wash stations are a lifesaver—no more messy baths at home after a fun day at the park!\n\nThe fitness center is another highlight, equipped with high-quality machines and plenty of space to work out. It’s always clean and well-maintained, making it easy to stick to my fitness goals.\n\nThe location is also ideal. It’s conveniently situated near shops, restaurants, and parks, making it easy to get out and enjoy everything the area has to offer.\n\nOverall, I love living here at Parkside! It feels like a community, and I’m grateful for the friendly staff and great amenities. If you’re considering a new place to live, definitely check this place out!",

I hope this review has helped keep the potential residents informed on what this apartment does to people during a pandemic.\nEdit: In reply to managements comment. We used to live at a sister property to this complex. We transfered our lease to Parkside for the job opportunities. We were led to believe that we would be having the exact same lease since both properties were owned by the same person and managed by Lincoln. We new that the lease breaking for the other property would be one months rent and a 30 day notice. We were under the impression that they had given us the exact same rules and lease transfer points. We both know we should have read more into the small print and finer points. But, we were too trusting of the company. Even now, there is still miscommunication between the team and leaders. We were told we could leave our keys and they would still allow us to pay the 60 day notice for each month's rent. Then we receive an email stating that if we left them our keys they want the extra $3000 immediately. We aren't asking for our money back. But, we want to keep others from making the same mistake we did and being screwed out of a lot of money during these times.\n\nYou should avoid Parkside at all costs. They take advantage of the pandemic and people losing jobs. My husband and I moved to Parkside for work. But, due to Covid, we are now having to relocate to Ohio. Parkside has demanded more then $7000 from us. Due to circumstances, our jobs are not able to help relocate. We owe more then $7000 after they have taken our deposits.  We are not the only ones, we have neighbors getting ready to take out loans so that they can provide for their family so that they can relocate for work. We tried talking to them to let them know we needed to relocate for jobs. They would not work with us. We asked if we could transfer our lease and were refused. Because of the Pandemic, they have revoked the ability to transfer to sister properties. This place is taking advantage of those being affected by Covid. This is such a bad company and apartment. We asked if we could set up a payment plan, and Ty in Leasing said he would ask corporate and ghosted us. I cannot voice how horrible this complex is. If you move here. Make sure to check every hidden fee as well as do not be in a situation of having to relocate due to jobs, family, and Covid. Also, we were the first ones living in the apartment.  And you can see how cheaply it is put together. We have had pants torn as well as cuts to ourselves and our dogs due to exposed painted over nails. Our cabinets lost their handles, and the drywall looks as if it is falling off the walls.",

As previous tenants stated, the property management changed a few times while living there & after move out it took 9 MONTHS to receive not even half of our security deposit. We left the unit spotless, professionally cleaned. They charge luxury prices but not a luxury experience!! Pitiful. They made it so difficult to get in contact with those in charge of returning deposits. I would call, email, left voicemails to property and the management company with no solution or help for 9months!!!! Ridiculous!! Also beware of the Ant problem it’s true- 2 of our bedrooms and living room became infested with ants! It was terrible. Dog poop everywhere when walking around the property as well. If you have kids beware of the speeding in/near parking garage. They never ever had security gates put up either during that time which lead to theft of our property in Jan 2023. Hopefully some changes have been made- Beware!",

I had to deal with a terrible ant infestation that persisted the entirety of my lease with the complex. Management NEVER fixed the situation, despite me asking AT LEAST a dozen times for them to find me a better pest treatment. The apartment was built cheaply too, and the walls and paint would easily dirty. There was no way to wash or remove the stains, unless you wanted create further damage. On top of this, my bike was STOLEN out of the community bike storage room, even though I had it locked up. This bike room was first advertised to me as a complex amenity while taking a tour of the place. WHAT A JOKE. I never understood why there was a key card entry for the gym but not the bike room…? There was even a security camera in the entree way of the building the bike room is in—and still nothing was done by management to review footage and help me solve the theft. I had to file a police report and tried asking management to send me video footage from the security camera but I, along with the officer on my case, got nothing but RADIO SILENCE from the complex. They then lied to me about returning the officer’s call. Management failed me in so many ways during my stay that the only thing I can do to feel better is to warn others. Don’t live here!

Pretty sure there are rats are around to chew through the paper thin walls with fast food trash all around the garage and halls. Loud dogs bark all day and night.  Pests and gnats in your apartment. Red ants in between the walls during the summer coming out the outlets. They charge $25 for useless fetch delivery services. So expect your rent to go up another $300 from listing price with all the extra fees. With the new apartment developments on N Mays pay a little extra for something new with better amenities.

Anyone can drive in and through the complex, despite them advertising as a private parking lot.  This has been the case since Avenue 5 has purchased the property back in June 2021.  They have not been able to get trash cleanup under control.  They have not fixed issues with the mail room and now they keep YOUR packages in their office.  This makes it super inconvenient to get your mail.  The dog park is sad and often taken over by the same groups of people with hostile dogs that force you to leave.  The parking garage is a danger because this property has no speed bumps or mirrors or signage.  People speed all the time through here.  You cannot smoke inside the property yet there are no smoking designated areas outside.  There has been zero improvements made and in fact, many amenities are now worthless or not working here.  Yet they have the nerve to raise rent on everyone?  Do yourself a huge favor and ignore or move out of this complex.",

Lincoln, Assurance, then Greystar. When I moved in, the carpets were installed incorrectly leaving hills (which they are charging me for). There were always issues with the trash valet. And now that I moved out, they are charging me for damages that I did not make. They are also trying to charge me for things that don’t appear damaged (the toilet photo). They even tried charging me for damage to my outside wall which people hit with furniture while moving in/out. I attached images of the items I tried to dispute with Sherron Joseph at Greystar but she would ignore my emails. Now they sent me to debt collections while still not responding to my questions. Shameful.\n\nUpdate: I paid the remaining note from when I was sent to collections. They were non negotiable and would not respond to my emails prior to the deadline. I decided to pay because I am just a person and they are a huge corp that would drown me in legal bills when they sue me.

Our apartment also towed my car without warning and did not let me know leading me to panicking at 7:00 in the morning with no way to get to college and calling the police to try and figure out hat happened to my car. Furthermore parking that used to be free now cost money if you want to park by the doors. I recently was contacted by management after posting this review to a company survey and they ensured me they would look into it and get back to me the next day about making it up to me. It’s been a week and they are no longer responding to my emails and have done nothing to rectify these issues.I heavily recommend thinking twice before leasing here.",

About eight months after Avenue 5 took over, it was not the smoothest transition, and unfortunately, they let the community go down. It is not what it once was but have they ever done anything that directly affected my living? The answer is no things they could work on would be making sure staff can answer questions and are available to answer the phone. This was very frustrating. Also, the turnover was horrible maintenance seems like they could use a little better guidance as work orders were being closed out but not done. Also, instead of nitpicking about yards and what people put on them, how about fixing the more prominent issues the complex has had since Avenue 5 took over? Would I recommend living here? I would, but you will need a lot of patience and need to ignore the problems that this company still hasn't figured out yet. I would give this a solid 3/5, and that's just me being lucky enough never to have problems with my specific unit hope they get it together apartment still has a lot of potentials.",

When logging into my leasing portal it clearly stated that my vehicle was there and was a vehicle for my unit. They said that it was not under my vip parking and they don’t release the keys unless there is a vehicle signed up under that softwar. However, my keys were given to me without verification on that so this all fall backs on their lack of communication. Also, back track two months when I got the keys my unit was FILTHY with stains all over the fridge, dog hair in the unit, unmapped floors that after stepping on the floor with white socks turned my socks BLACK! I asked them to send someone to clean it the following day before I moved my furniture in when the furniture company got there on their time being paid from my own wallet the unit was not cleaned and was still in the same disgusting condition it was given to me in. As a new resident I am extremely disappointed in the customer service aspect of how things have been handled since the jump. Not to mention, they have an officer on the property who feels the need to harass residents like he’s apart of the office staff and as a woman living in her unit alone that is quite intimidating and does not make me feel comfortable here at all. He asked me my unit number on multiple occasions which does not make me feel at home one bit. This has been a whole situation. Working two jobs and being in Nursing school I barely have free time to myself and to be late to class because my vehicle was towed without actually being contacted to see if there was some type of mistake or what is super disappointing. I will not be renewing my lease here I’m thinking of terminating it. This is ridiculous.",

          "text": "Update: 4/2023\nWhere to begin....this place is a mess, from the management/staff to the billing. We just moved out and were charged $10 (for a trashbag and other fraudulent fees - and they took our deposit (that they said they did not receive)). There was absolutely nothing in the apartment so, why did you charge for a trashbag? In our previous apartment unit, they charged $300 plus for a nail in the wall and carpet cleaning - cleaning they would normally do for each unit anyway - and for carpet that did NOT contain not one blemish or stain. This place is just a money pit. They CHARGE and CHARGE...but, take a look at the hallways, how they (do not) upkeep the buildings, the crime (yes - I will say it again) that occurs on the grounds. They claim this review is fraudulent but, if you live/lived there, you know what I mean...they sit in the office, look at their computers, and rack up the payments! They could care less about residents or the issues within the community - which is evident by their (lack of) action, over-billing, and deaf ears.\n\nOlder Review:\nIt appears Parkside has been removing some of their reviews.\nSo, I will add another one. Yesterday there were at least 15 Round Rock police officers in the complex, including SWAT - in a standoff for at least 4 hours. This is not acceptable. The management (2nd set since January of this year) need to be more mindful and selective of who they allow to move in...They are so focused on having 100% occupancy that they are not paying attention to red flags. The place is a hot mess.\n\nLooks good on the outside. On the inside the place is falling apart, literally.\n\nManagement is invisible within the community. On-site security is a joke. Some of the cameras on the property do not work. Our neighbor found this out the hard way when someone backed into her car. You get a different answer each time you enter the office - it depends on who to speak with. The staff follow-up is horrible. Trash piled up so high in the garages, it is ridiculous and the smell is horrible. The hallways contain blood, dog poop, dog hair, and other unmentionables. Maintenance shows up unannounced (even when no issue is reported).",

And my view is literally a chef's kiss. Great value for the price and super fab facilities all while being a stone's throw from beautiful east & downtown (if you're into that sorta thing). very clean when I moved in and already feels like home. Alexandria also goes out of her way to make folks feel included with various community activities etc.! a true shining star. Also S/O to the maintenance and pest control guys, they're 1-800-on-the-ball.\n\nMy only qualm would be that the towing company (that probably has an agreement w/ the building but idk) circle's the visitor lot each evening like blood-thirsty shahhks at feedin' time. It's extremely easy, (albeit slightly inconvenient) to register a guest's plate, make/model etc. on the app every time they visit- but also easy to forget and if you do- you're chum in the water my friend.\n\nI understand the towing company needs to get their bag, and this isn't the building per se, but  when I moved in my leg was broken so my sisters would come by a lot to help me out and I ran out of parking permits which sucked. Aside from that ONE inconvenient aspect, terrific experience.",

          "text": "I had several people warn me about moving into this complex before I moved in. During my first few weeks here, I also noticed that even residents who live here seemed hesitant when walking me through the community. I tried to stay optimistic, but things have continued to go wrong.\n\nThey have repeatedly messed up my rent, and I’ve had to go into the office multiple times to get it corrected. The hot water regularly goes out. Trash valet does not run nearly as smoothly as advertised. There are homeless individuals living in the dumpster area, and until very recently, there was no nighttime security at all. To be clear, they just hired nighttime security a couple of days ago, after months of ongoing issues reported by residents.\n\nThere are no security cameras in the hallways or parking lots because management claims it would be an “infringement of privacy,” even though residents have repeatedly asked for basic safety measures. Packages go missing almost daily, despite management insisting their mail delivery system is “foolproof.” It isn’t. Someone’s car was stolen (not towed—stolen) from inside the gated parking lot.\n\nThe parking areas are constantly littered with residents’ dog poop. I personally had a package stolen from the mailroom, and management admitted they have video footage of a homeless man entering and stealing packages. On top of that, my rental vehicle was towed even though I had a valid visitor permit.\n\nI’ve lived here for less than two months and have experienced an unbelievable number of issues. There is an entire resident group chat that is nothing but daily complaints about how poorly this place is managed. I truly tried to stay positive and go with the flow, but I’m exhausted by the constant problems and the lack of meaningful action from management.\n\nI do not recommend moving here.",

Huge island in the kitchen with white counter tops.\nVery new, paint is not chipped or gross.\nThe tubs are pretty big and wide.\nWalls in the units are pretty thick.\nThe pool/pool area is usually kept very clean\nThe building is About 10 minutes from the airport but you barley hear planes!\nThere’s a community pool/billiards table.\nThere’s a little market in the mail room full of snacks you can buy.\nThey’ll do monthly community events like yoga or brunch!\n\nCONS:\nlots of security concern. Lots of package theft- even with their fetch service. Fetch has not the best hours too which aren’t helpful if you work long days. Be prepared to buy a ring camera.\nShower water is finicky. Lots of water issues. Don’t recommend if you love hot showers. This is my biggest issue\nWalking/parking near the dog park always smells like piss or poop :( people don’t always use baggies to pick up the poop\nThe balconies that face the pool get COVERED in dust and dirt. It’s hard to have furniture and plants.\nThey did a resident of the month event thing… and had an AI resident to win the prize …\nThe hallways on the various floors are not cleaned often unless you ask them to clean it\n\nA lot of the reviews seem to be from people who only toured and haven’t moved in so that made me wary\n\nFYI:\nBe very careful with guest parking because they always have tow trucks taking cars.\n\nApartment was not cleaned upon move in - BUT management did make it up to us with a credit towards our rent.\n\nIgnore reviews about grey star since kairoi is the new management.\n\nWith the X free weeks of move in deal, if you choose to Prorate rent it needs to be done manually with a money order. Can’t be done through the app. Not awful just inconvenient.",

          "text": "This is the worst apartment I’ve lived in for the price that they charge. Take recent reviews with a grain of salt because they capture the opinions of new residents rather than long term ones such as myself. On the surface it seems like a decent apartment. They have a nice business center, lobby, pool area, and rooftop. But I would say the praise ends there. Allen is the typically the one that responds to us the most so I will give them credit for that employee in specific.\n\nThere are systemic issues that only temporarily get fixed. Sometimes, the parking lot exit gates do not automatically open. The dog park is pathetic - it’s small and has turf, which traps every type of smell from pet bathroom breaks. The residents as a whole don’t care to pick up after their dogs. Consistent water pressure issues pop up every few months. Same with the elevator, which they don’t care to fix permanently. Even when the elevator does work, there’s always some sort of mess on the floor (the cleaning crew barely cleans it as is). The AC system gets overburdened and our electricity costs get driven up because it takes 2 hours to cool a small 1 bedroom. The printer periodically does not work. The staff does not care to upkeep the coffee machine. We went through a property management change where we switched from the horrendous Greystar to Kairoi. I will give the leasing office some credit for being a bit more responsive, however I don’t think I should praise on-site staff for doing the bare minimum. They gave minimal notice when it came to the parking registration rules which is not legally complaint (I pointed it out and they did not respond) Given how they handle issues, I really don’t think they care about improving the resident experience. I’ve never been so happy to move out of a complex.",

The rules are constantly changing and impossible to keep up with. There is a tow truck there almost every night and it costs $240 to pick up your car. It is not clear where you can and can't park and even though I thought I knew the rules I have been towed twice. Terrible experience for guests and residents.

You will constantly has packages stolen, trash absolutely everywhere in the halls/stairs and around the property.

He’s got that perfect mix of professional and “I got you, bestie” energy, and I am here for it. Seriously, give this man a crown already — he keeps this place together and makes it feel like more than just a building. Claudio, you’re a star! 🌟💖👏",

Again, having rented in Austin from greystar and maa for 7+ years I have never received a single lease violation, though after 4 months here have received 3.\n\nThe units themselves are fine aside from a major apartment wide mold issue l, but it’s management that makes living in this community a complete nightmare. Management will find a reason to fine you at least once monthly. They overcharged me $70 for utilities and after months of back and forth where the leasing office assured me they would refund the mistake, the manager admitted he had no intention of doing this. There is a major issue with humidity in building one, leading many of the residents to find mold covering their clothes and shoes. I’ve put in several work orders about abnormally high humidity levels (residents have reported upwards of 70% humidity recorded in unit) with no change. My walls and cabinets are often covered in condensation, and any paper goods in my unit are immediately damaged. If you’re looking to get fined $50 for forgetting to bring your broom in after sweeping the patio of your apartment while the elevators, doors, and gates are constantly broken and the pool is constantly closed ( Don’t forget about that mold issue) this is the place for you. If you like getting towed and receiving attitude from the leasing staff who will NOT refund you, or if you like it when your friends get towed (properly registered residents and visitors are often towed) or having your car stolen… this is a great place. I have never in my 7 years of renting dealt with such constant aggression and intense scrutiny from management and am excited to not renew my lease at this apartment.",

I have not received any recent reports of registered vehicles being towed but would happy to look into this for you, if you'd like to email me the details. Also, we haven't had any true vehicle thefts at the site that have been reported. There was one repossession of a vehicle but that was handled by a third party.

          "text": "I’ve lived in this apartment complex for two years. I was the first resident to move into my apartment. Overall, I love living here. Great location for me. Nice pool with gas grills. One of the better onsite gyms I’ve seen. Nice shared work space, lobby area and rooftop clubhouse but I don’t really use those much. The ONE amenity I use daily is the large grass area behind the complex that we were permitted to use for our dogs. Lately, they decided that because of a report of a flea infestation months ago that through a series of supposed exchanges with the city, we aren’t allowed to use the area any longer and doing so would be a lease violation. Having broken vehicle and pedestrian gates, doors within the community that don’t lock properly, rampant package theft even with the forced use of Fetch package delivery service instead of the onsite lockers we used to use and sketchy vehicle transactions happening in the parking lot don’t seem to be any concern to management. I brought a lot of these security concerns to management on April 6, 2023 and they still haven’t been fixed but keeping my dog out of an area we’ve used for two years is apparently more important.\n\nEDIT (01/08/2024): The security issues still remain but the complex has put a padlock on the gate into the large grass area that we use as an off-leash pet area.  I'm sure they'll say \"it was the city\" but the city isn't going to come out and unlock that gate when the landscapers come.  Stop lying.",

          "text": "A Bewildering Experience at Nexus East Apartment Complex.\n\nI am writing this review to express my deep dissatisfaction with Nexus East Apartment Complex. While I initially moved in with high hopes, my experience has been marred by a series of frustrations and disappointments.\n\nFirstly, I've had several issues with the maintenance staff. On multiple occasions, they have entered my apartment without prior notice or while I was not present, which is a gross invasion of my privacy. The lack of respect for the personal space of tenants is extremely troubling.\n\nSecondly, the advertisement of a dog park and water retention park was a major selling point for me. However, this turned out to be false advertising. The so-called \"dog park\" is nothing more than a tiny patch of fake grass, and the \"water retention park\" is now non-existent. This misleading information is not only unethical but also a disservice to potential residents who are making decisions based on these amenities.\n\nLastly, and perhaps most concerning, is the issue with the complex's gates. They are frequently broken and remain open, allowing free access to the property. This lack of security has directly resulted in thefts in the complex. The management has shown little urgency or concern in addressing this significant safety issue.\n\nFurthermore, the customer service at Nexus East is deplorable. The management lacks accountability and has shown little to no interest in resolving the issues we have brought to their attention. Requests and complaints seem to fall on deaf ears, leaving us feeling ignored and undervalued as residents.\n\nIn conclusion, living at Nexus East Apartment Complex has been a frustrating and disappointing experience. The management's lack of regard for tenant rights, false advertisement of amenities, and poor customer service have made my stay here an ordeal. I strongly advise potential renters to consider these issues before choosing to live at Nexus East.",

          "text": "CHOOSE SOMEWHERE ELSE!\n\nI usually give places the benefit of the doubt, but this was a really awful experience at these apartments. The staff is constantly changing. Some are very nice, but there are some VERY rude members even when you are trying to be polite and cordial.\n\nThe apartments are new, but are very cheaply made. The cabinets and doors are thin and easily broken. The large sinks are not set right so they do not drain and accumulate water and grime. The washing machine sets off the breaker every other time, so if you try doing a was while gone or over night you will find your clothes sitting, submerged in water. Insects and bugs are everywhere. They fill the semi-open air stairwells. The stairwells are NEVER cleaned of trash, spills, or spiderwebs. In 2 bedrooms the AC is near the guest room and gets that room very cold while the rest of the apartment gets no AC. No vent valves to redirect air.\n\nThen there are the Air B&Bers. The apartment puts up its own units on air b&b for extra income. This means that there is a constant flow of travelers who get locked outside, trash the stairwells and hallways, and never put their trash out right so that the trash service won't take it and it will sit there in the hallways with nothing done to it for weeks. They also bring their dogs which have attacked other tenants with no repercussions\n\nFinally, when I moved out they sent me a bill for $1400 owed after deposit. I used a cleaning service, but they charged me with $200 \"Heavy Cleaning\" fee and $750 for new carpet and padding. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the carpet.\n\nThis was one of the most disappointing rental experiences I have ever had. The Nexus is WAYYY over priced for what you get. I would pick the next apartment on your list.",

Per the history of the community, we did have concerns with AirBnB but weekly we check to see if there are any posted and give violations. We do offer corporate leasing with vetted companies you may see these residents coming in.

The property manager Richy was super friendly and helpful with every step of my move in process. When I first toured the complex, I noticed right away how nice and clean the property was, especially the pool! And once we went into the apartment unit I was going to be renting, I knew this was going to be the perfect place for me. The apartment is newly remodeled and even smelled so clean, really felt like home already. I can gladly say I would 100% recommend this complex for any future renters.",

I applied somewhere else and sent my new address to the property manager on the 12th requesting my refund be sent and received no response.\n\nI called several times at which I was ignored. I then called from a different phone number right after which was prompt answered. The manager tells me that they only send out requests twice a month. This was a new to me, as I asked how long it would take to receive my money back and was told within 14 days and no mention of when it would be requested which to me should have been immediately since it was taking so long to get a decision.\n\nI've contacted their corporate office on my own instead of trusting an email with one person's name because I have absolutely no trust in what I've been told, and am angered by the treatment and holding of my funds. 14 days is up!\nHopefully the management company will follow up.\n\nI only came to this property because I was told they would work with me. This property is barely maintained, trash in the walk ways along with other undesirable elements and have the nerve to keep me waiting as if this is some gem of a property, and is a far far cry from anything such.\n\nThis is my experience getting the runaround with the property manager there, whose name is Richie. I don't know if this is standard business practice for AMC Properties but he is the only one that I have seen at this property so there was no hope for a better experience with any other agent.",

          "text": "6/30/24 UPDATE: The entire complex is in disarray, heaps of dog poop EVERYWHERE, Kids toys, Trash, bird poop covering stairs, Lights knocked over, Broken lights, If you own a vehicle, You’ll soon realize why EVERY vehicle has a theft proof cover over their license plate, One of the Tenants that’s lived here as long as I have, Stole my tag and put it on his vehicle. Then aggressively confronted us for calling the cops on his poor choices. Its the weekend before 4th of July and our pool is neon green, Again. Palm Tree seed pods are covering the pool. If this place was maintained properly, They would know Palm Trees need to be trimmed before they start to seed or it can cause bigger problems. 6/19/2023 UPDATE: It’s Monday and Richie can’t seem to answer the phone. SHOCKER! We just passed Father’s Day weekend with a green pool- OUR ONLY AMENITY we pay for looks like shrecks swamp water. We have broken parking lot lights that have been like this for over a month, That could cause serious injury. Talking with a neighbor, Turns out we don’t have a maintenance man either!!!! Pathetic…. Allll these issues and the office manager trots around telling everyone he now lives on property, all while he literally can’t even answer the phone, Nor take care of the property.\n\n11/3/22 UPDATE: Bianca the so called “office lady” STILL won’t answer the phone NOR follow up with broken appliances. THEY DONT FIX ANYTHING. Can you say GHETTO?  Now owned by a NEW OWNER. We were notified by once again, Changing the requirements of HOW we pay rent, Keep in mind it’s costing extra just TO GET RENT PAID. I am in a Lease, The new company is charging extra. As for Jasmine Womack’s review, You give a place that has ROACHES 3 stars? Ew. Have a higher expectations.\n\nThis property does not value the tenants that reside here. Every month it’s a huge hassle to even pay rent. They keep changing what kind of payment they will accept, with that every month each method has hidden fees. They are essentially pushing us to have no other option than Auto-Pay. I could see using Auto pay if this was a luxury apartment, but we pay for a green pool, no gym or grills & unimaginable dirty property. See pics below for proof. We pay over $1500 a month for a neon green pool.(Dont forget the hidden fees to even pay your rent)  I asked temp office manager as to why we don’t have a gym when there’s been a gym here for over 10 years, What WAS a gym is now turned into a dirty storage room. Bianca the new office manager is quite literally useless. She doesn’t answer numerous phone calls, nor emails I’ve sent.",
